## Part 1: The philosophy

### Core thesis (Crespo)

When AI commoditizes functionality, the products that win are the ones that feel
like **places you want to inhabit**. Three principles:

1. **Define the feeling, not features** — start with emotional intent
2. **Give the internet texture** — tactile, handcrafted materiality
3. **Every surface is the product** — atmospheric consistency from landing to footer

## Part 2: Products that feel like places

### Tier 1 — The canonical examples

#### Cora (cora.computer) — Every's AI email assistant
**Screenshot:** `cora-landing.png`

The primary example from Crespo's article. Oil-painted sky backgrounds (8k-10k px resolution),
canvas grain texture, Signifier serif + Switzer sans-serif. The design deliberately violates
"best practices" — texture over flat colors, paintings over backdrops. Sends beautiful
twice-daily "briefs" instead of real-time inbox.

**What creates the atmosphere:** You arrive into a sky, not a feature list. The product UI
floats as if suspended in atmosphere. The sky continues scrolling with painted clouds and trees.

**Lesson for us:** A single bold environmental choice (Cora's painted sky) can transform a
page from "reading about email" to "experiencing calm." Our Bloom's color palette could be
our equivalent of Cora's sky — a domain-specific visual language that defines the atmosphere.

---

#### Linear (linear.app) — Product development system
**Screenshot:** `linear-landing.png`

Dark UI, Inter font, gradient purple sphere logo. Monochrome black/white with almost no color.
The restraint itself is the statement. Subtly transparent header at 85% opacity. Every pixel deliberate.

**What creates the atmosphere:** Typography as hero. No feature cards, no testimonial
carousels. The homepage reads like a manifesto about how software should feel.

**Lesson for us:** Restraint communicates confidence. Our landing page has the hero copy
("Teaching, reasoned.") but surrounds it with standard SaaS scaffolding. Linear proves you
can let the words breathe.

---

#### Brilliant (brilliant.org) — Interactive STEM learning
**Screenshot:** `brilliant-landing.png`

The gold standard for education-as-place. "Learn by doing" — no videos, everything interactive.
Game Feel North Star developed with ustwo (Monument Valley studio). Rive animations for
streak celebrations and learning pathways. Custom typefaces from Contrast Foundry.

**What creates the atmosphere:** You are always *touching* diagrams, rearranging code,
interacting with data. The product feels tactile and alive, not passive.

**Lesson for us:** The most directly relevant example. What if our landing page let
educators *experience* the pedagogical reasoning engine instead of reading about it?
An interactive Bloom's taxonomy visualization, a live skill graph snippet, or a
mini-assessment conversation could replace the feature cards.

---

### Tier 2 — Strong atmospheric identity

#### Spiral (writewithspiral.com) — Every's AI writing tool
**Screenshot:** `spiral-landing.png`

Warm off-white background with visible grain/noise texture — "papery feeling." Elegant
serif headline. Extreme restraint and whitespace. The page breathes.

**Lesson for us:** Texture is cheap and effective. Adding paper grain to our warm
`#faf9f7` background would immediately differentiate from flat SaaS. Our Source Serif 4
headings already have bookish gravity — lean into it.

---

#### Pi.ai — Emotionally intelligent AI companion
**Screenshot:** `pi-landing.png`

Warm cream/beige background with floating conversation-starter cards. Designed by AKQA.
The introduction "invites you to get to know Pi" rather than teaching you how to use it.
Conversational warmth is the entire product identity.

**Lesson for us:** Directly relevant to our /teach chat page. Pi shows that the
emotional register of an AI conversation — how it *feels* to talk to it — matters
more than its feature set. Our chat should feel like sitting down with a knowledgeable
colleague, not booting up a tool. The floating suggestion cards are a pattern we could
adopt for the empty state.

---

#### Are.na (are.na) — Creative community
**Screenshot:** `arena-landing.png`

Almost entirely text. No hero image, no gradient, no animation. Reads like a manifesto:
"online software for saving and organizing content," "a toolkit for assembling new worlds
from the scraps of the old." No likes, no algorithms, no ads.

**Lesson for us:** Radical simplicity and values-first messaging create atmosphere.
Our product has a clear pedagogical philosophy — "interview first, generate second" —
that could speak as powerfully as Are.na's manifesto if surfaced on the landing page.

---

#### Cosmos (cosmos.so) — Visual bookmarking
**Screenshot:** `cosmos-landing.png`

Dark canvas with luminous floating content clusters. No hero section. Microinteractions
choreographed as a journey. Strategic depth and spatial storytelling.

**Lesson for us:** The skill graph visualization already exists in our product. What if
the landing page *was* the skill graph — a living, glowing dependency graph that visitors
could explore, with Bloom's colors creating the luminous-on-dark aesthetic?

---

#### Poolsuite (poolsuite.net) — Eternal summer vibes
**Screenshot:** `poolsuite-landing.png`

Retro Macintosh desktop, pixel art, CRT-style glow, floating windows, looping vacation
footage. Pure atmosphere, zero utility beyond mood.

**Lesson for us:** Not directly applicable to our design language, but proves that
a product can BE a place without any features at all. The commitment to a single
aesthetic idea is total.

---

### Tier 3 — Educational products with atmosphere

#### Mathigon (mathigon.org) — The Mathematical Playground
**Screenshot:** `mathigon-landing.png`

Rich warm colors (reds, oranges, purples), colorful illustrated course cards,
discovery-based progression. Content is gated by genuine understanding, not clicking "next."

**Lesson for us:** Mathigon treats mathematics as inherently beautiful. We should treat
pedagogy as inherently beautiful — the skill graph, the Bloom's taxonomy levels, the
dependency chains are visually rich structures. Show them.

---

#### Nicky Case (ncase.me) — Interactive explorations
**Screenshot:** `ncase-landing.png`

Hand-drawn indie aesthetic. "Hi, I'm Nicky! I make shtuff for curious & playful folks."
Each project is a self-contained interactive world for learning.

**Lesson for us:** The "explorable explanation" pattern — learning through interactive
play — is the ideal for our landing page. What if visitors could play with a mini skill
graph, see how dependency inference works, or experience a 30-second assessment conversation?

---

#### Duolingo (duolingo.com) — Gamified language learning

Blue-and-green with generous whitespace. Duo the owl is not just a logo — a character
with emotions and humor. Variable rewards, streaks, personality-driven messaging.

**Lesson for us:** Character and personality differentiate. We don't need a mascot, but
our product has a *voice* — it pushes back on bad plans, it teaches pedagogical principles,
it accumulates wisdom. That voice could come through on the landing page.

---

#### Khanmigo (khanmigo.ai) — AI tutor that refuses to give answers

The most important UX feature is a *constraint*: the AI cannot give you the answer.
Socratic method as interface design.

**Lesson for us:** Our engine already does this — it interviews first, reasons about
skill structure, pushes back. This is a differentiator worth showing, not just telling.

---

## Part 3: What creates "arriving somewhere" (synthesis)

Across 60+ products analyzed, the patterns that separate places from tools:

### 1. Environmental cues before informational ones
Stripe's gradient, Cora's painted sky, Cosmos's dark canvas — you sense the atmosphere
before you read a word. The standard SaaS hero headline asks you to read; places ask
you to *feel* first.

### 2. Restraint as identity
Linear, Are.na, Read.cv, mymind — what they leave out defines them. No testimonial
carousels, no feature grids, no "trusted by" logos. Absence of noise communicates taste.

### 3. The page mirrors the product's own logic
Raycast's homepage feels like a command palette. Brilliant's homepage IS interactive
learning. Cosmos's homepage IS visual discovery. The marketing page and the product
are the same thing.

### 4. Invitation over conversion
Clay's "we would be honoured to have you join," Pasqua's "Start The Experience,"
Arc's membership card — signup framed as entering a community, not completing a transaction.

### 5. One bold atmospheric choice, not many features
Stripe has the gradient. Linear has monochrome restraint. Cosmos has the dark canvas.
Cora has the painted sky. Each commits to one environmental idea and lets it define everything.

### 6. Constraints as features
Khanmigo refuses to give answers. Minerva Forum makes hiding impossible. Brilliant has
no videos. The most distinctive products are defined by what they *won't* do.

### 7. Texture and materiality
Oil paint (Cora), paper grain (Spiral), noise (modern trend), hand-drawn illustration
(Nicky Case, Notion). Static flat surfaces feel like documents. Textured surfaces feel
like physical spaces.

### 8. Immediate tactile feedback
Brilliant's interactive diagrams, Observable's reactive cells, Desmos's sliders.
The product responds to your touch instantly. Latency is the enemy of feeling "in" a place.

## Part 4: Recommendations for the Pedagogical Engine

### Landing page — Priority changes

#### 1. Lead with atmosphere, not information
**Instead of:** Hero headline + 3 feature cards + 4 link cards
**Consider:** The Bloom's color spectrum as an ambient visual element. A subtle,
animated gradient that shifts through the six Bloom's levels (slate > blue > green >
amber > orange > rose) as you scroll — the same way Stripe uses its WebGL gradient.
Not decorative — it's our domain-specific visual identity.

#### 2. Show, don't tell — make the landing page interactive
**Inspired by:** Brilliant, Nicky Case, Explorable Explanations
**Consider:** A mini interactive element on the landing page:
- A small skill graph that visitors can hover/click to see dependency chains
- A 3-message assessment conversation snippet (shows the engine thinking, not just talking)
- An animated Bloom's taxonomy where hovering reveals what each level means for teaching

#### 3. Add texture to the warm palette
**Inspired by:** Spiral's paper grain, Cora's painted backgrounds
**Consider:** A subtle noise/grain overlay on the `#faf9f7` background. This single
CSS change would immediately differentiate from flat Tailwind templates. The papery
warmth is already in the color — make it tactile.

#### 4. Let the philosophy speak
**Inspired by:** Are.na's manifesto, Linear's confidence
**Consider:** Replace or augment the feature cards with the product's voice:
"Interview first, generate second." "Every lesson comes with reasoning traces."
"It will push back if your plan has gaps." Let the copy carry conviction
without the scaffolding of icons and card borders.

#### 5. Break the card monoculture
**Inspired by:** Across all examples
The current page uses `rounded-xl border border-border-subtle bg-surface-0 p-6` for
every card. Vary visual weight by purpose — the "What makes this different" section
could be full-bleed text, the "See it in action" section could use live miniature
previews instead of link cards.

### /teach chat — Priority changes

#### 1. Entry experience (highest impact)
**Inspired by:** Pi.ai's floating conversation cards, Cora's atmospheric arrival
When an educator opens /teach, before they type anything, show:
- A warm welcome that references context (domain, group, last session)
- Floating suggestion cards for common starting points: "Plan a lesson,"
  "Assess my students," "Debrief last session," "Build a new domain"
- A subtle Bloom's color accent that shifts based on what the engine is doing

#### 2. Emotional register
**Inspired by:** Pi.ai, Khanmigo
The chat should feel like sitting down with a knowledgeable colleague.
Pi.ai proves that warmth in the first moment matters more than features.
Khanmigo proves that what the AI *refuses* to do (give easy answers)
can be a design feature.
