# Product Description: The AI Teaching Partner

---

## What is it?

An AI teaching partner that thinks like a teacher — not a content generator that thinks like a search engine.

You tell it what you want to teach. It interviews you: Who are your students? What do they already know? Where are you teaching — a classroom, a park, over Zoom, one-on-one? How much time do you have?

Then it builds you a complete plan. Not a curriculum outline. A real lesson plan — the kind you'd get from a master teacher who's done this a thousand times. Down to the minute-by-minute beats, the prerequisites your students need, which students to pair together, and the links and tools they'll need before they walk in the door.

## Who is it for?

Educators. All of them.

- A **classroom teacher** managing 30 students with different skill levels
- A **park naturalist** leading a group through a trail with no Wi-Fi and no projector
- An **online instructor** running a data science bootcamp for 200 students across Latin America
- A **homeschool parent** teaching three kids at different ages and levels
- A **1:1 coach** helping a professional level up in AI and data engineering
- A **workshop facilitator** running a two-hour hands-on session at a conference

The system doesn't care about the setting. It adapts because it understands the fundamentals: what people know, what they need to learn, and what constraints shape how you teach.

## What does it do?

### It assesses what your students know — without testing everything

If a student can run a Python script, the system infers they can install Python, open a terminal, navigate directories, and understand what a script is. It maps the dependencies between skills so you don't waste time testing what's already obvious.

It doesn't just check "do you know X?" It assesses *how deeply* they know it — can they recall it, apply it, analyze with it, create with it.

### It manages your students as a group

Whether you have 1 student or 200, the system tracks what each person knows, where the gaps are, and how the group fits together. It can tell you: "80% of your students are stuck on the same prerequisite" or "pair this person with that person — their skills complement each other."

### It creates lesson plans that feel like stage direction

You describe what you want to teach. The system interviews you to understand the full context. Then it builds:

- **A prerequisites checklist** — what students need before the session, with links and setup instructions
- **A tool and logistics audit** — do students need subscriptions? An internet connection? Specific software? Physical materials?
- **A timed session plan** — not just "cover topic A then topic B" but "by minute 14, you need to transition to the hands-on exercise or you won't have enough time for the debrief"
- **Activities calibrated to your students** — individualized where possible, leveraging group dynamics where useful
- **Contingency notes** — if students struggle with X, here's how to pivot

It's like having a master teacher and a stage director collaborating on your session plan.

## What makes it different?

**It interviews you first.** Most AI tools jump straight to generating output. This system asks questions before it produces anything, because a lesson plan for 30 high schoolers in a lab is fundamentally different from the same topic taught to 5 adults on a hiking trail.

**It reasons about skills, not content.** It doesn't generate worksheets or quiz questions from a textbook. It understands the *structure* of knowledge — what depends on what, what implies what, where the gaps are — and uses that structure to compose experiences.

**It works anywhere.** A park with no internet. A home kitchen. A Zoom call. A conference room. A one-on-one coaching session. Because the system is built on universal primitives (skills, dependencies, learner profiles, groups, constraints), it adapts to any setting without needing setting-specific features.

**It thinks like a teacher, not a search engine.** It doesn't retrieve lesson plans from a database. It *reasons* about your specific students, your specific constraints, and your specific goals to compose something tailored to your situation.

## The vision

Every educator — regardless of setting, subject, or scale — should have access to the kind of thoughtful, individualized planning that only the best-resourced schools can afford today. Not by replacing the educator, but by giving them a thinking partner that handles the complexity so they can focus on what they do best: teach.
