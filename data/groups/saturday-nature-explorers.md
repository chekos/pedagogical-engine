- Jordan Reeves (`jordan-reeves`)
- Elena Vasquez (`elena-vasquez`)

## Interview Context

- **Topic:** Outdoor ecology — habitat observation, species identification, and ecosystem health assessment
- **Duration:** 2 hours (10:00 AM – 12:00 PM)
- **Setting:** Riverside County Park — 1.5-mile loop trail with creek crossing, meadow, oak woodland, and wetland edge. Pavilion available as rain shelter.
- **Audience:** Homeschool co-op youth ages 12–15, mixed urban/rural backgrounds
- **Tools available:** Hand lenses (6x), field guides (trees, wildflowers, tracks), pH test strips, collection jars, clipboards with field journal sheets, compasses, topographic trail map
- **Connectivity:** None — no cell signal on most of the trail. All materials must be physical.
- **Prior sessions:** 1 previous session — indoor orientation covering what ecology is, what a naturalist does, and basic safety rules
- **Weather plan:** If raining, use the pavilion for field guide work, specimen examination, and journaling. Reschedule creek and meadow activities.

## Constraints

- 2-hour session hard stop (parents pick up at noon)
- No internet — all reference materials must be printed or in books
- Buddy system required at all times on trail
- Sam has a severe bee sting allergy — group must know his EpiPen location; avoid disturbing flowering areas unnecessarily
- Jordan needs active tasks — more than 10 minutes of quiet observation and he disengages
- Maya is shy — avoid putting her on the spot for presentations; let her volunteer
- All students must stay within sight of an adult on the trail
- Bring water bottles — no drinking fountains on the trail
- Poison ivy is present along the creek — teach identification before approaching the water
