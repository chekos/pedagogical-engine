## Members

- Priya Sharma (`priya-sharma`)
- Marcus Johnson (`marcus-johnson`)
- Sofia Ramirez (`sofia-ramirez`)
- Alex Chen (`alex-chen`)
- Nkechi Okonkwo (`nkechi-okonkwo`)

## Interview Context

- **Topic:** Python data analysis — cleaning, exploring, and visualizing real-world datasets
- **Duration:** 90 minutes
- **Setting:** Computer lab with 20 workstations, projector, whiteboard
- **Audience:** Community college continuing education students, ages 22–55
- **Tools available:** Python 3.11, Jupyter notebooks, pandas, matplotlib (all pre-installed)
- **Connectivity:** Reliable WiFi
- **Prior sessions:** 2 previous sessions covering Python basics (variables, control flow, functions)
- **Constraints:** Mixed experience levels — some students have professional spreadsheet experience, others are career changers with no data background

## Affective Context

- **Group confidence:** mixed — Priya is highly confident, Sofia and Nkechi are moderate, Marcus has topic-specific low confidence (Python), Alex is low overall. The group's average confidence is below their average skill level — they know more than they think they do
- **Group motivation:** mostly intrinsic — 3/5 are self-motivated career changers or skill builders. Nkechi is externally motivated (lab requirement). Sofia has a mix of external (manager's suggestion) and social motivation
- **Social dynamics:**
  - Priya + Alex: good mentor/mentee pairing. Priya is patient with Alex
  - Sofia + Nkechi: natural partners (similar level, complementary skills, good rapport)
  - Marcus: prefers solo work due to accessibility setup, but engages well in whole-class discussion
  - Alex + Nkechi: avoid pairing — Nkechi's pace would overwhelm Alex
  - No known conflicts in the group
- **Past experiences:**
  - Marcus: bad experience with a previous online Python tutorial (accessibility issues). Almost quit after session 1
  - Alex: no negative experiences, but the novelty of coding is emotionally taxing. Almost didn't return after session 1
  - Others: no notable negative experiences
- **Overall affective read:** This group needs confidence building more than challenge escalation. Start sessions with a guaranteed win. Be especially attentive to Marcus and Alex during exercises. Frame mistakes as learning, not failure

## Constraints

- 90-minute hard stop (evening class, students commute)
- Must accommodate range from near-beginner to intermediate
- Students requested more hands-on exercises, less lecture
- One student (Marcus) has a visual impairment — needs high-contrast materials and screen reader compatibility
- No homework can be assigned (continuing ed policy)
