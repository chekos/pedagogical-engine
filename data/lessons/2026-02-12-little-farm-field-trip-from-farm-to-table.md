# Lesson Plan: Little Farm Field Trip -- From Farm to Table

**Prepared for:** Maria (Naturalist, Tilden Nature Area, East Bay Regional Parks)
**Date:** Tuesday, February 17, 2026
**Domain:** farm-science

---

## Session Overview

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Topic** | Farm animals, plant life, and the journey food takes from farm to plate |
| **Audience** | 24 third graders from Manzanita Elementary, Oakland (~50% English learners; Spanish and Cantonese primary languages) |
| **Setting** | Little Farm at Tilden Nature Area -- all outdoors, paved paths only. Animal pens (cows, pigs, goats), chicken area, vegetable garden, portable whiteboard station. |
| **Duration** | 2 hours total. 15 min arrival/bathroom at start, 15 min wrap-up at end = **90 minutes of station teaching time** |
| **Materials** | Clipboards (24), crayons (shared bins), portable whiteboard, printed bilingual vocabulary cards, printed station worksheets, 4 chaperone instruction sheets |
| **The one thing** | Every student leaves able to point to a food on their lunch tray and say where it came from -- the animal or plant, and the farm work that got it to their plate. |

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, students will be able to:

1. Name at least 3 farm animals and describe what each provides to people *(Bloom's: COMPREHENSION)*
2. Identify basic plant parts (seed, root, stem, leaf) on a real plant and describe what plants need to grow *(Bloom's: COMPREHENSION)*
3. Trace a food item from its farm origin (seed or animal) to the plate using drawings and words *(Bloom's: APPLICATION)*
4. Observe a living thing using their senses and record the observation with a labeled drawing *(Bloom's: APPLICATION)*

### Prerequisite Audit Results

The audit tool flags all target skills at 0% coverage. This is expected and correct -- this is the students' first farm visit. The lesson is designed to teach all skills from scratch using hands-on discovery at each station. No skills are assumed.

**What students DO bring:**
- Completed classroom unit on seasons and weather (they understand sun, rain, temperature)
- A few students have family garden experience (use them as peer experts at Station 3)
- Basic drawing and labeling skills (developing writers -- worksheets are drawing-heavy by design)
- Curiosity and excitement about seeing real farm animals for the first time

**What students do NOT bring (and we must teach):**
- Farm animal identification beyond pictures
- Knowledge of what animals provide (milk, eggs, wool)
- Plant part vocabulary (seed, root, stem, leaf)
- Ability to sequence seed-to-plant growth stages
- Farm-to-table tracing skills

### Accessibility Plan

This section is critical. Read it before anything else on the morning of the trip.

**Wheelchair user (1 student):**
- All 4 stations are placed on paved, flat ground. Confirm this during your pre-visit walkthrough (arrive 20 min early).
- Station 1 (Animal Pens): Position at the paved viewing area by the fence. The student can see and hear animals from the paved path. Do NOT place this station on the dirt area beyond the fence.
- Station 2 (Chicken Coop): Use the paved overlook near the chicken enclosure. If the coop entrance has a step, the chaperone brings a chicken-feather sample and egg to the student at the paved area.
- Station 3 (Garden): Use the paved edge of the garden beds. Raised beds are ideal -- the student can touch plants from chair height.
- Station 4 (Whiteboard): Portable whiteboard goes on the paved picnic area. No accessibility barriers.
- Assign this student to a group with a strong chaperone. Brief the chaperone specifically: "Your group stays on paved paths. If a path is blocked or muddy, you reroute. You never leave this student behind while the group moves ahead."

**Asthma students (2 students):**
- These students MUST NOT enter the hay barn. Period. There is no reason any group enters the hay barn during this lesson.
- Position these students upwind of dusty areas when possible. If wind is blowing dust from the animal pens, stand on the opposite side of the path.
- Both students should be in different groups (split the risk -- if one group encounters dust, the other does not).
- Chaperones for these groups carry the students' inhalers. Confirm inhaler location with the classroom teacher before departure from school.
- If it is a dry, dusty day: shorten time at Station 1 (animal pens) by 3 minutes for these groups and add 3 minutes at Station 4 (whiteboard area, paved, less dust).

**EL students (~12 students, Spanish and Cantonese primary languages):**
- Bilingual vocabulary cards (English/Spanish with pictures) are distributed at arrival. Every key term has a picture. Students carry these on clipboards throughout the trip.
- Cantonese speakers: vocabulary cards are English/Spanish only (per educator request). These students benefit from the picture support and hands-on activities. Pair Cantonese speakers with bilingual peers when possible.
- Station instructions are spoken in English with Spanish translation by chaperones (brief chaperones on key Spanish phrases -- see Chaperone Instructions below).
- Every activity is hands-on or drawing-based. No activity depends on reading or writing fluency.

### Differentiation Strategy

This is a whole-class field trip, not a tracked lesson. All 24 students rotate through the same 4 stations in groups of 6. Differentiation happens through:

1. **Drawing vs. writing:** Developing writers draw and label with one word. Stronger writers draw and write a sentence. The worksheet accommodates both.
2. **Peer knowledge:** Students with family gardens are assets at Station 3. Ask them to share what they know: "Does anyone grow vegetables at home? What do you grow?"
3. **Vocabulary cards:** EL students use the bilingual cards as scaffolding at every station. All students get them (normalizes the support).
4. **Chaperone scaffolding:** Each chaperone has a script with key questions and prompts. They do not lecture -- they ask questions and point.

## Timed Session Plan

---

### PHASE 0: ARRIVAL AND SETUP (0:00 - 0:15)

---

**[0:00-0:05] Bus arrival and bathroom (5 min)**

Maria: Meet the bus at the Little Farm parking area. Greet the class. Direct students to the bathroom immediately -- they have been on a bus. Count heads as they come off the bus. Confirm 24 students + classroom teacher + 4 chaperones = 29 people.

Students: Use bathroom, stretch legs, look around with wide eyes. This is exciting. Let them have 2 minutes of unstructured wonder.

Watch for: Students who wander toward the animals immediately. Have chaperones gently corral them: "We are going to meet the animals in just a few minutes. Stay with your group."

**[0:05-0:10] Clipboard distribution and vocabulary card orientation (5 min)**

Maria: As students come out of the bathroom, hand each one a clipboard with their worksheet and vocabulary card sheet already clipped on. Crayons go in bins -- one bin per group of 6.

Say (loudly, to the whole group gathered in the picnic area): "Good morning, Manzanita! Welcome to the Little Farm. My name is Maria, and I am a naturalist -- that means my job is to learn about nature and help YOU learn about nature too."

"On your clipboard, you have two things. Hold up your clipboard." (Wait.) "The top sheet is your vocabulary card. It has pictures and words in English and Spanish. You will use this all day. Flip to the next page -- that is your worksheet. You will draw and write at every station."

Hold up a vocabulary card sheet so they can see it. Point to one entry: "See? COW -- VACA." Point to the picture. "Every station, you will use these words."

Students: Hold up clipboards. Look at vocabulary cards. Flip pages.

Watch for: Students who did not get a clipboard. Have 2-3 extras ready. Students who cannot read the cards -- that is fine; the pictures carry the meaning.

**[0:10-0:15] Chaperone briefing and group formation (5 min)**

Maria: Pull the 4 chaperones aside (classroom teacher watches the kids for 3 minutes). Hand each chaperone their instruction sheet. Say:

"You each have a group of 6 kids. Your sheet tells you what to do at each station. The most important thing: you are NOT lecturing. You ASK questions. Point at things. Let the kids discover. When they draw, help them label. When they are stuck, use the guiding questions on your sheet."

"Every 18 minutes, I blow the whistle. That means finish your drawing and walk to the next station. You rotate clockwise. I will point you in the right direction."

Point to each station: "Station 1 is the animal pens over there. Station 2 is the chicken area. Station 3 is the garden. Station 4 is right here at the whiteboard."

To Chaperone 1 specifically: "Your group has [wheelchair student name]. Stay on the paved path at all times. At the animal pens, use the viewing area by the fence -- do not go onto the dirt path."

To Chaperones 2 and 3: "You each have an asthma student. Keep them away from the hay barn. If it is dusty at the animal pens, stand upwind. You have their inhaler, right?" (Confirm.)

Students: Form into their 4 groups. Chaperones gather their 6 students.

Time check: By 0:15, groups must be formed and walking to their first station. If you are behind, shorten the vocabulary card orientation -- students will figure out the cards at the first station.

---

### PHASE 1: STATION ROTATIONS (0:15 - 1:36)

Each station runs for 18 minutes. Transitions are 3 minutes. Maria floats between stations, checking timing, helping chaperones, and handling problems. Maria does NOT run a station -- she is the director, circulating.

---

#### STATION 1: ANIMAL FRIENDS (at the animal pens -- cows, pigs, goats)

*Target skills: identify-farm-animals (Bloom's: KNOWLEDGE), animal-products (Bloom's: COMPREHENSION), observe-living-things (Bloom's: APPLICATION), record-observations (Bloom's: APPLICATION)*

**Location:** Paved viewing area at the animal pen fence. Wheelchair accessible. If the area is small, position 3 students at the fence and rotate every 6 minutes.

**Station sign:** "STATION 1: ANIMAL FRIENDS / ESTACION 1: AMIGOS ANIMALES" with drawings of cow, pig, goat.

**[Minutes 0-4] Look and Name (4 min)**

Chaperone: Gather the group at the fence. Say: "Let us look at the animals. What do you see?" Point at each animal. Wait for students to name them.

If students are shy: Point directly at a cow. "What is this animal?" Wait. If nobody answers: "This is a cow. In Spanish: VACA. Can you find the word on your vocabulary card?"

Go through each visible animal: cow/vaca, pig/cerdo, goat/cabra. Have students point to each word on their vocabulary card as you name them.

Students: Look at animals. Name them. Find words on vocabulary cards.

Watch for: Students who are scared of the animals. This is normal for first-time farm visitors. Say: "The animals are behind the fence. They cannot reach you. You are safe." Let scared students stand a step back.

Watch for: Overexcited students who try to climb the fence or reach through. "Hands on your side of the fence. We look with our eyes. The animals do not like grabby hands."

**[Minutes 4-10] What Do They Give Us? (6 min)**

Chaperone: Point to the cow. Ask: "What does a cow give us that we eat or drink?"

Take answers. Guide toward: MILK (leche). "Yes! Cows give us milk. What do we make from milk?" (Cheese, yogurt, ice cream, butter.)

Point to the goat. "Goats also give milk! And what about their fur?" Touch your own clothes. "Goat hair can be made into soft fabric."

Point to the pig. "What does a pig give us?" Students may say bacon, ham, pork. Affirm: "Yes. Pigs give us meat like bacon and ham."

Key teaching moment: "Every animal on this farm gives us something. Cows give milk. Goats give milk and fiber. Pigs give meat. These animals help feed people."

For EL students: As you name each product, point to the vocabulary card. Milk/leche. Say both words. Have students repeat.

Students: Answer questions. Repeat vocabulary words. Look at animals while connecting them to food products.

**[Minutes 10-16] Draw and Record (6 min)**

Chaperone: "Now it is drawing time. Open your worksheet to the STATION 1 page. Pick ONE animal. Draw that animal. Try to draw what you really see -- look at the animal while you draw."

"Under your drawing, write or draw what that animal gives us. If you drew a cow, draw a milk jug next to it. Try to write the word too."

Walk around and help students label their drawings. For EL students: point to the vocabulary card for spelling. For developing writers: "Just write the first letter if that is all you can do. Or draw a picture of milk."

Students: Draw one animal. Label it. Draw/write what it provides.

Watch for: Students who try to draw all three animals -- redirect them: "Pick your favorite one. Draw it big. Add details -- does it have spots? How many legs? What color?"

Watch for: Students who finish fast. Extension: "Draw a second animal on the back of your page. Or draw what the animal's food looks like -- what does a cow eat?"

**[Minutes 16-18] Station wrap-up (2 min)**

Chaperone: "Pencils down in one minute. Finish your label." At 18 minutes: "Clip your worksheet back on your clipboard. Stand up. We are moving to the next station."

---

#### STATION 2: CHICKEN COOP AND EGGS (chicken area)

*Target skills: identify-farm-animals (Bloom's: KNOWLEDGE), animal-products (Bloom's: COMPREHENSION), observe-living-things (Bloom's: APPLICATION), record-observations (Bloom's: APPLICATION)*

**Location:** Paved area near the chicken enclosure. If the coop entrance has a step or unpaved ground, stay outside the enclosure and observe through the fence/wire. Wheelchair student stays on paved path -- chaperone brings a feather and egg to the student if the viewing angle is limited.

**Station sign:** "STATION 2: CHICKEN COOP / ESTACION 2: GALLINERO" with drawings of chicken and egg.

**Props at this station:** 1 real egg (hardboiled for safety, or a fresh farm egg if available), 2-3 chicken feathers collected by Maria before the trip.

**[Minutes 0-4] Observe the Chickens (4 min)**

Chaperone: "Look at the chickens. What do you notice? Tell me something about how they look or what they are doing."

Take observations. Guide with questions:
- "How many legs does a chicken have?" (2)
- "What covers a chicken's body?" (Feathers/plumas)
- "What is that red thing on top of its head?" (Comb -- say: "It is called a comb. It helps the chicken stay cool.")
- "What sound does a chicken make?" (Let them imitate -- this is fun and memorable.)
- "What are the chickens doing right now?" (Eating, walking, scratching the ground, sitting.)

Students: Observe. Answer questions. Point. Imitate chicken sounds (briefly -- keep it to 30 seconds or it devolves).

Watch for: Students who are scared of the chickens. Chickens are less intimidating than cows, but some kids are startled by flapping. "Chickens flap their wings sometimes. It is just how they move. They are not trying to get you."

**[Minutes 4-8] Eggs and Feathers -- What Chickens Give Us (4 min)**

Chaperone: Hold up the real egg. "What is this?" (Egg/huevo.) "Where does it come from?" (A chicken.) "A chicken lays an egg almost every day. This egg could become your breakfast -- scrambled eggs, fried eggs, eggs in pancakes."

Pass the egg around carefully. Let each student hold it for 5 seconds. "Feel how smooth the shell is. Feel how light it is."

Hold up a feather. "What is this?" (Feather/pluma.) "Chickens give us feathers too. People used to write with feathers -- they are called quills. Feathers are also stuffed inside pillows and coats to keep us warm."

Pass 2-3 feathers around. Let students feel them. "Is it soft or rough? Heavy or light?"

Students: Hold the egg. Feel the feather. Make observations. Find "egg/huevo" and "feather/pluma" on vocabulary cards.

Watch for: Dropped eggs. If using a real egg, have a backup. If using a hardboiled egg, no problem. You can also use a wooden or plastic egg if you want zero risk. The tactile experience matters more than authenticity.

**[Minutes 8-14] Draw and Record (6 min)**

Chaperone: "Open your worksheet to STATION 2. Draw a chicken. Look at the real chicken while you draw -- not from your imagination. Draw what you actually see."

"Next to your chicken, draw what chickens give us. An egg. A feather. Try to label them: EGG/HUEVO, FEATHER/PLUMA."

For students who finish quickly: "Can you draw the life cycle? First an egg, then a baby chick, then a grown chicken, then the chicken lays an egg. Draw arrows between them to show the cycle."

Students: Draw a chicken from observation. Draw and label egg and feather.

Watch for: Students drawing a cartoon chicken instead of observing the real one. Gently redirect: "Look at the real chicken. How many toes does it have? What color is it really? Draw what you see, not what you remember from TV."

**[Minutes 14-18] Feather Observation Challenge (4 min)**

Chaperone: If you have magnifying glasses, hand them out. If not, students use their eyes up close.

"Hold your feather close to your face. Look at the tiny lines coming off the center. Those are called barbs. Can you see how they stick together, like a zipper? Gently pull two barbs apart. Now press them back together. See how they zip back up?"

"On the back of your Station 2 page, draw a CLOSE-UP of the feather. Draw it BIG -- fill the whole space. Try to draw the barbs."

Students: Examine feather closely. Draw a detailed feather observation.

This is a pure observation/recording activity. It builds the observe-living-things and record-observations skills without any reading or writing.

---

#### STATION 3: GARDEN DISCOVERY (vegetable garden)

*Target skills: identify-plant-parts (Bloom's: KNOWLEDGE), plant-needs (Bloom's: COMPREHENSION), seed-to-plant (Bloom's: COMPREHENSION), observe-living-things (Bloom's: APPLICATION), record-observations (Bloom's: APPLICATION)*

**Location:** Paved edge of the vegetable garden. Use raised beds if available (ideal for wheelchair access -- student can touch plants at chair height). If garden is ground-level, have 2-3 students kneel at the bed edge while others wait, then rotate.

**Station sign:** "STATION 3: GARDEN DISCOVERY / ESTACION 3: DESCUBRIMIENTO EN EL JARDIN" with drawings of plant, sun, water drop.

**Props at this station:** Seed packet (beans), Ziploc bag with 5-6 different seeds, magnifying glasses (if available).

**[Minutes 0-5] Plant Parts Scavenger Hunt (5 min)**

Chaperone: "We are going to look for plant parts. I am going to say a part of a plant, and you have to POINT to it on a real plant. Ready?"

Point to a plant in the garden. "Find the STEM/TALLO." (Students point to the stem.) "That is the stem. It holds the plant up, like your backbone holds you up."

"Find a LEAF/HOJA." (Students point.) "Leaves catch sunlight. They are like the plant's solar panels."

"Can you find a ROOT/RAIZ?" (They probably cannot see it.) "Roots are underground. They drink water from the soil, like a straw. We cannot see them, but they are there."

"Can you find a FLOWER/FLOR?" (If there is one in the garden.) "Flowers make seeds. After the flower, a fruit or vegetable grows."

After each one, have students find the word on their vocabulary card and point to it.

Students: Point to plant parts on real plants. Repeat vocabulary words. Find words on cards.

Watch for: Students who have family gardens. Ask: "Does anyone grow plants at home? What do you grow?" Let them share for 30-60 seconds. They are peer experts here.

**[Minutes 5-10] What Do Plants Need? (5 min)**

Chaperone: "Plants are alive, just like animals. But they cannot walk to the kitchen and get food. So what do they need to grow?"

Hold up three fingers. "Plants need three things."

Point up at the sky. "Number one: SUN/SOL. Plants eat sunlight. That is their food." (Students look up, find "sun/sol" on card.)

Point to the ground/soil. "Number two: SOIL/TIERRA. Plants live in soil. Their roots drink water and nutrients from the soil." If there is a bare patch of dirt near the garden, let students touch it. "Feel the soil. Is it wet or dry? Plants like it a little wet."

Pretend to pour water. "Number three: WATER/AGUA. Plants are thirsty! That is why we water a garden." If there is a hose or watering can visible, point to it.

"So: sun, water, soil. SOL, AGUA, TIERRA. Say it with me." (Students repeat.)

Students: Repeat three things plants need. Touch soil. Look at sun. Find words on vocabulary cards.

Watch for: Students who say "air" -- that is correct too! Say: "Great thinking! Plants also need air. For today, let us focus on the three we can see: sun, water, soil."

**[Minutes 10-14] Seeds to Plants (4 min)**

Chaperone: Open the seed packet. Pour some seeds into your hand. "These are bean seeds. SEMILLA/SEED." Pass them around -- let each student hold one.

Open the Ziploc bag of assorted seeds. "Look -- seeds come in all sizes. This tiny one is a lettuce seed. This big one is a sunflower seed. This bumpy one is corn. They are all seeds, but they grow into VERY different plants."

Point to a plant in the garden. "This plant started as a tiny seed like this one." Hold up a seed. "First it was a SEED. Then it went into the SOIL. Then with SUN and WATER, it grew a little SPROUT." (Use your hands to show something small poking up from the ground.) "Then it grew a STEM and LEAVES. Then maybe a FLOWER. And then a FRUIT or VEGETABLE that we can eat."

"Seed, sprout, plant, flower, fruit. That is the life cycle." Show this sequence with gestures: pinch (seed), push up from ground (sprout), spread arms (plant), cup hands (flower), pretend to pick something (fruit).

Students: Hold seeds. Watch the life cycle gesture sequence. Try the gestures themselves.

**[Minutes 14-18] Draw and Record (4 min)**

Chaperone: "Open your worksheet to STATION 3. You have two tasks."

"First: pick a plant from the garden. Draw it. Label the parts you can see: stem, leaf, flower, fruit. Use your vocabulary card for spelling."

"Second: in the four boxes at the bottom, draw the life cycle. Box 1: seed. Box 2: sprout. Box 3: plant with leaves. Box 4: plant with fruit. Draw arrows between them."

Students: Draw a real plant with labeled parts. Draw the 4-step life cycle.

Watch for: Students who rush the life cycle and draw random things in the boxes. Point to the boxes: "Box 1 should be the very beginning -- just a tiny seed in the dirt. Box 2 is what happens next -- a little green sprout poking up."

For students who finish fast: "Under your life cycle, write one sentence: What do plants need to grow?" (Answer: sun, water, soil.)

---

#### STATION 4: FARM TO TABLE (portable whiteboard area, paved picnic area)

*Target skills: farm-to-table (Bloom's: APPLICATION), food-from-plants (Bloom's: APPLICATION), food-from-animals (Bloom's: APPLICATION), record-observations (Bloom's: APPLICATION)*

**Location:** Paved picnic area. Portable whiteboard set up. This is the synthesis station -- it ties together everything from the other three stations. Students who arrive here first (before visiting animal/garden stations) will have a lighter version; students who arrive here last will synthesize the most.

**Station sign:** "STATION 4: FARM TO TABLE / ESTACION 4: DE LA GRANJA A LA MESA" with drawing of a path from a barn to a plate.

**Whiteboard prep (Maria draws this before the trip starts):**

On the portable whiteboard, draw two columns:
```
FROM ANIMALS              FROM PLANTS
(De los animales)         (De las plantas)
   milk / leche              lettuce / lechuga
   eggs / huevos             tomato / tomate
   ___________              ___________
   ___________              ___________
```

Leave blank lines for students to fill in.

**[Minutes 0-4] Sorting Game: Animals or Plants? (4 min)**

Chaperone: "We are going to play a game. I am going to say a food. You tell me: does it come from an ANIMAL or a PLANT? And then, which animal or which plant?"

Call out foods one at a time. After each answer, a student comes to the whiteboard and writes or draws the food in the correct column. (For non-writers, they draw it.)

Foods to call out:
- "Cheese!" (Animal -- made from cow's milk)
- "Carrot!" (Plant -- it is a root!)
- "Egg!" (Animal -- from a chicken)
- "Apple!" (Plant -- it is a fruit)
- "Bacon!" (Animal -- from a pig)
- "Rice!" (Plant -- it is a seed/grain)

Keep the pace quick. One food every 30-40 seconds. Students should be shouting out answers.

Students: Shout answers. Come up to whiteboard to write/draw in the correct column.

Watch for: Students who do not know -- that is okay. Say: "Does cheese come from a cow or a carrot plant? Think about what cheese is made from." Give them the scaffolding, not the answer.

Watch for: This is the most physically still station. If energy is low, add movement: "If it comes from an animal, STAND UP. If it comes from a plant, CROUCH DOWN." (Total body response -- great for EL students.)

**[Minutes 4-12] Farm to Table Journey Map (8 min)**

Chaperone: "Now we are going to trace where one food comes from. Pick a food you eat -- maybe something from your lunch today."

On the whiteboard, draw a simple 4-step path:
```
[Farm/Granja] --> [Harvest/Collect] --> [Store/Truck] --> [Your Plate/Tu plato]
```

Model one example first: "Let us trace MILK."

Draw quickly:
1. "It starts at the farm. A cow lives here." (Draw a cow.)
2. "A farmer milks the cow." (Draw a person with a bucket.)
3. "The milk goes into a truck and drives to the store." (Draw a truck, then a store.)
4. "Your family buys it at the store, and it goes on your table." (Draw a glass of milk on a plate.)

"That is the journey: farm to table. Granja a mesa."

"Now YOUR turn. On your worksheet, Station 4 page, draw the journey for a food YOU choose. Pick any food. Draw the 4 steps. You can use the whiteboard example as a model."

Students: Choose a food. Draw the 4-step journey on their worksheet.

Walk around and ask each student: "What food did you pick? Where does it start? What happens next?"

Watch for: Students who pick complex foods (pizza, sandwich). Help them simplify: "Pizza has lots of ingredients. Pick just ONE ingredient -- like the cheese. Where does cheese start?"

Watch for: Students who cannot get past step 1. Scaffold: "Okay, you picked an apple. Where do apples grow?" (On a tree.) "Draw a tree with apples. That is step 1. Now what happens? Does someone pick the apples?" (Yes.) "Draw that. That is step 2."

Extension for fast finishers: "Trace a SECOND food. This time, pick one from the opposite column -- if your first food was from an animal, pick a plant food this time."

**[Minutes 12-16] Share Your Journey (4 min)**

Chaperone: "Who wants to show their food journey? Hold up your worksheet and tell us: what food did you pick, and how did it get from the farm to your plate?"

Take 2-3 volunteers. Each student holds up their worksheet and talks through their 4 steps. The other students listen.

After each share, the chaperone asks the group: "Did they get the steps right? Is there anything they missed?"

Students: Share drawings. Listen to peers. Give feedback.

Watch for: Students who are too shy to present. Do not force it. Say: "That is okay. Can I hold up your worksheet and tell the class about it while you nod yes or no?" This lets them participate without speaking.

**[Minutes 16-18] Station wrap-up (2 min)**

Chaperone: "Great work. Clip your worksheet back. Get ready to move."

---

### PHASE 2: WHOLE-GROUP WRAP-UP (1:36 - 1:45)

---

**[1:36-1:39] Gather at the picnic area (3 min)**

Maria: Blow the whistle twice (the "everybody come here" signal). All 4 groups converge on the picnic area. Students sit on the ground or at picnic benches. Wheelchair student parks at the end of a bench row.

Say: "Everybody find a seat. Clipboards on your laps."

**[1:39-1:41] The Big Question (2 min)**

Maria: "We have been all over the farm today. You met animals. You explored the garden. You traced food from the farm to your plate. Now I have one big question."

Hold up a food item (an apple, or a carrot, or whatever you have in your bag -- bring one real food item for this moment).

"Where does THIS come from? Who can tell me the whole story?"

Take 2-3 hands. Guide the student through the full chain: "It starts as a seed... then it grows into a tree... a farmer picks it... it goes on a truck to the store... your family buys it... and it ends up HERE." Hold up the food.

"Every single thing you eat has a story like this. It all starts at a farm."

Students: Raise hands. Tell the food's story. Listen to peers.

**[1:41-1:44] Three Things I Learned (3 min)**

Maria: "Turn to the person next to you. Tell them THREE things you learned today. Go."

Give them 90 seconds. The picnic area will get loud. That is good -- it means they are talking.

Then: "Who can share one thing you learned?" Take 3-4 quick answers. Affirm each one: "Yes! Great observation." "That is exactly right." "I love that you noticed that."

Students: Talk in pairs. Share with the whole group.

Watch for: This is the assessment moment. Listen for whether students can name animals and what they provide, identify plant parts, and describe the farm-to-table journey. You do not need a formal quiz -- just listen.

**[1:44-1:45] Closing (1 min)**

Maria: "Thank you for being such great scientists today. You observed, you drew, you learned where your food comes from. Next time you eat lunch, look at your food and think: where did this start? What is its story?"

"Now let us use the bathroom and get back on the bus."

---

### PHASE 3: DEPARTURE (1:45 - 2:00)

---

**[1:45-2:00] Bathroom, clipboard collection, bus loading (15 min)**

Maria: Direct students to bathroom. Collect clipboards (students keep their worksheets -- pull them off the clips). Count heads before loading the bus.

Hand the classroom teacher the stack of worksheets: "These make a great follow-up activity back in the classroom. Students can color their drawings, add sentences, or present their farm-to-table journey to the class."

Thank each chaperone by name.

Count heads one final time as students board the bus. Wave goodbye.

## Chaperone Instruction Sheet (Appendix C -- Print 4 Copies)

### CHAPERONE GUIDE -- Little Farm Field Trip

**Your name: ________________  Your group: ________________**

**Your job:** Ask questions. Point at things. Help kids draw and label. You are NOT lecturing -- you are guiding discovery.

**Rotation signal:** One long whistle = finish your drawing, move to next station.
**Direction:** Move clockwise. Maria will point you.
**Time at each station:** 18 minutes.

**Key Spanish phrases (for EL students):**
- "Mira!" = Look!
- "Que ves?" = What do you see?
- "Dibuja aqui" = Draw here
- "Muy bien!" = Very good!
- "Como se llama?" = What is it called?
- "De donde viene?" = Where does it come from?

**If a student:**
- **Is scared of an animal:** "You are safe. The fence is between you and the animal. You can stand back here."
- **Cannot write:** "That is okay. Draw a picture instead. Or tell me and I will help you write the word."
- **Finishes early:** "Draw another animal/plant. Or help your neighbor label their drawing."
- **Is off task:** "Let us look at your worksheet. What station are we at? What do you need to draw?"
- **Needs the bathroom:** Walk them to the bathroom by the parking area. Do NOT send a third grader alone. Take the whole group if needed, or ask Maria to watch your group.

**STATION 1: ANIMAL FRIENDS -- Guiding Questions:**
- What animal is that?
- What sound does it make?
- What does it give us? (milk, meat, wool)
- What does it eat?

**STATION 2: CHICKEN COOP -- Guiding Questions:**
- How many legs does a chicken have?
- What covers its body? (feathers)
- What do chickens give us? (eggs, feathers)
- What is the red thing on its head? (comb)

**STATION 3: GARDEN -- Guiding Questions:**
- Can you find the stem? The leaves?
- What do plants need to grow? (sun, water, soil)
- What was this plant before it was big? (a seed)
- Does anyone grow plants at home?

**STATION 4: FARM TO TABLE -- Guiding Questions:**
- Where does [food] come from? An animal or a plant?
- What happens after the farmer grows/raises it?
- How does it get from the farm to the store?
- How does it get from the store to your plate?

**SAFETY REMINDERS:**
- Stay on paved paths at ALL times (wheelchair student access).
- Do NOT enter the hay barn (asthma risk).
- Students do not feed the animals unless Maria says so.
- Count your 6 students every time you move between stations.
- Carry the inhaler for your asthma student (if applicable).

## Activities Summary

### Activity 1: Animal Friends Station

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Objective** | Name farm animals and what they provide; observe and draw a real animal |
| **Duration** | 18 minutes |
| **Format** | Small group (6 students + 1 chaperone) |
| **Materials** | Clipboard, worksheet, crayons, vocabulary cards |

**Success criteria:** Student draws at least 1 animal and labels what it provides (milk, eggs, meat, wool -- at least 1 product).

**Common pitfalls:**
- Students draw from imagination instead of observation: "Look at the real cow. What color is it? Draw that color."
- Students cannot name products: Point to vocabulary card. "Cows give us... MILK. Can you find the picture of milk?"
- Fear of animals: Let them observe from a distance. Do not force proximity.

### Activity 2: Chicken Coop Station

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Objective** | Observe chickens closely; understand eggs and feathers as animal products; practice detailed observation drawing |
| **Duration** | 18 minutes |
| **Format** | Small group (6 students + 1 chaperone) |
| **Materials** | Clipboard, worksheet, crayons, vocabulary cards, real egg, feathers, magnifying glasses (optional) |

**Success criteria:** Student draws a chicken from observation (not cartoon), identifies eggs and feathers as chicken products, and attempts a close-up feather drawing.

**Common pitfalls:**
- Dropped egg: Have a backup or use a hardboiled egg.
- Students draw cartoon chickens: "Look at the real chicken. Count its toes. What color are its feathers really?"
- Feather observation is too abstract for some students: "Just draw the feather shape. Make it big. That is great."

### Activity 3: Garden Discovery Station

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Objective** | Identify plant parts on a real plant; state what plants need to grow; sequence the plant life cycle |
| **Duration** | 18 minutes |
| **Format** | Small group (6 students + 1 chaperone) |
| **Materials** | Clipboard, worksheet, crayons, vocabulary cards, seed packet, assorted seeds, magnifying glasses (optional) |

**Success criteria:** Student labels at least 2 plant parts on their drawing, names sun/water/soil as plant needs, and draws the 4-step life cycle.

**Common pitfalls:**
- Students cannot find roots (they are underground): "You are right -- we cannot see roots. But we know they are there, under the soil, drinking water. Draw them below the dirt line."
- Life cycle confusion (wrong order): Point to the seed in their hand. "This is step 1. What happens when you put it in soil and add water? A tiny green thing pokes up -- that is a sprout. That is step 2."
- Students with family gardens may want to talk at length: Give them 30-60 seconds, then redirect: "That is wonderful that you grow tomatoes at home. Can you help show the others what a stem looks like on this plant?"

### Activity 4: Farm to Table Station

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Objective** | Sort foods by animal vs. plant origin; trace one food item from farm to plate |
| **Duration** | 18 minutes |
| **Format** | Small group (6 students + 1 chaperone) with whole-group whiteboard interaction |
| **Materials** | Clipboard, worksheet, crayons, vocabulary cards, portable whiteboard, dry-erase markers |

**Success criteria:** Student correctly sorts at least 3 foods as animal/plant origin and draws a 4-step farm-to-table journey for one food.

**Common pitfalls:**
- Complex foods (pizza, tacos): "Pick just ONE ingredient. Where does the cheese come from?"
- Students cannot connect store to farm: "Before the apple was at the store, where was it? On a tree! At a farm. And how did it get from the farm to the store?" (A truck.)
- Students who arrive at this station FIRST (before visiting animals/garden) have less context: Start with the sorting game to build vocabulary, then do the journey map. The sorting game works even without prior stations.

## Contingency Notes

### If it rains

Light rain: Continue with the lesson. Clipboards can get a little wet. Move Station 4 (whiteboard) under the picnic shelter if there is one. Skip the detailed feather drawing at Station 2 (hard to draw in rain).

Heavy rain / thunderstorm: Move all groups under the picnic shelter. Collapse the 4 stations into 2 activities done as a whole group:
1. Vocabulary card review + sorting game (whiteboard) -- 20 minutes
2. Farm-to-table journey drawing at the picnic tables -- 20 minutes
Skip the animal and garden observation stations. It is disappointing, but safety comes first. Suggest the classroom teacher schedule a return visit.

### If a student has an asthma attack

Stop. Administer inhaler. The chaperone stays with the student. Maria radios (or calls) the park ranger station. If the student recovers: continue with a shorter station time, keeping that student at the least dusty station (Station 4, whiteboard area) for the rest of the trip. If the student does not recover quickly: call 911. The Tilden Nature Area address is 600 Canon Drive, Berkeley, CA 94708. The nearest hospital is Alta Bates Summit Medical Center, 2450 Ashby Avenue, Berkeley (about 10 minutes by car).

### If the wheelchair path is blocked (mud, equipment, construction)

Reroute. If one station is inaccessible, that group skips it and does a double session at Station 4 (the whiteboard area is always paved). Maria helps the chaperone adapt Station 4 to cover the missed content verbally and with drawing.

### If a chaperone does not show up

You have 3 chaperones instead of 4. Options:
- **Best option:** Make 3 groups of 8 instead of 4 groups of 6. Shorten station time to 15 minutes each (45 min for 3 rotations). Drop Station 4 (Farm to Table) and do it as a whole-group activity during wrap-up (extend wrap-up to 10 minutes).
- **Backup option:** Maria runs Station 4 herself and does not float. Three chaperones run the other stations. This means Maria cannot troubleshoot problems at other stations.

### If a chaperone is struggling (cannot manage the group, lost, confused)

Maria: Walk over to that station. Model one activity cycle for the chaperone. Say: "Watch me do this, then you take over for the next group." Leave the chaperone instruction sheet with them and move on. If the chaperone is truly overwhelmed, swap them to Station 4 (the most structured station with the whiteboard game) and take over their station yourself for the next rotation.

### If students are finishing stations too fast (done in 12 minutes)

Every station has extension activities built in:
- Station 1: Draw a second animal. Draw what the animal eats.
- Station 2: Draw the egg-to-chicken life cycle. Close-up feather drawing.
- Station 3: Draw a second plant. Write a sentence about what plants need.
- Station 4: Trace a second food. Compare an animal food and a plant food journey.

If ALL stations finish fast across ALL groups, shorten the rotation to 15 minutes and use the extra time for an extended wrap-up where students present their favorite drawing to the whole group.

### If students are finishing stations too slowly (not done at 18 minutes)

Blow the whistle at 18 minutes regardless. Say: "Finish the line you are drawing and move." Students will not complete every box on the worksheet -- that is okay. The worksheet is a scaffold, not a test. The experience of being at the station and engaging with the guiding questions is the learning. The worksheet documents it, but incomplete worksheets are still successful learning.

If ONE station is consistently slow (every group runs over), that station's chaperone needs to cut the final extension activity and spend more time on the core drawing.

### If students are scared of the animals and will not approach

This is common for first-time farm visitors, especially younger children. Do not force it.

- Start from far away. "Let us watch from here. What do you notice?"
- Let the brave students go first. Scared students will often follow once they see peers are safe.
- Use the fence: "See the fence? The animals stay on that side. You stay on this side. Nobody crosses."
- If a student is truly terrified, let them draw from memory at a nearby bench while the group observes. They still participate in the drawing activity.

### If the classroom teacher micromanages

Some teachers hover or override the chaperone's facilitation. Maria: "Mrs. [name], the chaperones have instruction sheets for each station. Would you be willing to float between groups like I am doing? That way every group gets extra support." Give the teacher a job that keeps them moving rather than anchored to one group.

## What To Cut If You Are Short on Time

Priority order (cut from the bottom first):

| Priority | What to Cut | Time Saved | Impact |
|---|---|---|---|
| CUT FIRST | Feather close-up drawing (Station 2, minutes 14-18) | 4 min | Low -- feather observation is enrichment, not a target skill |
| CUT SECOND | "Share Your Journey" at Station 4 (minutes 12-16) | 4 min | Low -- students still draw the journey; they just skip peer sharing |
| CUT THIRD | Life cycle drawing at Station 3 (minutes 14-18) | 4 min | Medium -- seed-to-plant is a target skill, but students still hear the explanation |
| CUT FOURTH | "Three Things I Learned" pair share in wrap-up | 3 min | Medium -- informal assessment is lost, but students still hear the closing |
| CUT FIFTH | Sorting game at Station 4 (minutes 0-4) | 4 min | Medium -- fun and active, but the journey map is more important |
| CUT SIXTH | Reduce each station to 14 min (saves 16 min total across 4 rotations) | 16 min | High -- rushing every station degrades all learning. Last resort. |

**Never cut:**
- The animal observation and drawing at Station 1 (it is the emotional highlight -- students meeting real animals for the first time)
- The "What Do Plants Need?" segment at Station 3 (it is a core learning objective and ties to their seasons/weather unit)
- The Farm to Table journey map at Station 4 (it is the synthesis activity -- the "one thing")
- The whole-group wrap-up question ("Where does THIS come from?") -- it is the assessment moment and the emotional anchor for the day

## Post-Trip Classroom Follow-Up (Suggestions for the Classroom Teacher)

Maria: Share these ideas with the classroom teacher on the bus ride home or via email.

1. **Gallery walk:** Students color and finish their worksheets. Post them on a bulletin board. Students walk around and read each other's farm-to-table journeys.
2. **Class book:** Compile all the farm-to-table journey drawings into a "Our Trip to the Little Farm" class book. Each student gets one page.
3. **Seed planting:** Plant bean seeds in cups in the classroom. Students observe and draw the growth stages over the next 2-3 weeks, connecting back to the Station 3 life cycle.
4. **Lunch tray investigation:** At lunch the next day, students identify 3 foods on their tray and trace each one back to a farm origin. "Where did the milk come from? Where did the bread come from?"
5. **Thank-you letters:** Students write (or draw) thank-you letters to Maria. Great writing practice and builds the farm-school relationship.
