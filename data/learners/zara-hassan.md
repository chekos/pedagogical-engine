## Notes

- 12 years old, most experienced cook in the group
- Learned traditional Somali and Middle Eastern cooking from her grandmother — strong intuitive skills
- Cooks "by feel" rather than measurement — she knows when the sauce looks right but cannot explain why
- Challenge: translating intuitive cooking knowledge into formal recipe skills (measuring, writing recipes, scaling)
- Follows halal dietary requirements — all meat must be halal-certified; no pork or alcohol-based extracts
- Can be a peer mentor for knife skills and heat management
- Weakness: has never baked or made Western-style doughs — this is genuinely new territory for her
- Very social — works well leading a small group, explains things patiently to younger kids
- Goal for her: bridge from apprentice-by-watching to independent cook who can plan and execute meals solo
