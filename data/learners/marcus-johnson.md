## Notes

- Accessibility needs: visual impairment — uses screen magnification and high-contrast mode
- Prefers working in the terminal over Jupyter (screen reader works better)
- 15 years of Excel experience — strong data intuition, just needs Python syntax
- Tends to get frustrated when he can't see the data easily — encourage df.to_string() output
- Very strong at interpreting results once he can see them — the bottleneck is getting the code right
- Intermediate overall — solid fundamentals but gaps in pandas-specific operations
