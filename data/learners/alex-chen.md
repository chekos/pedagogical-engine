## Notes

- Career changer from restaurant management — zero programming background before this course
- Beginner level — still building basic programming literacy
- Very motivated but gets overwhelmed easily
- Needs step-by-step scaffolding and frequent check-ins
- Benefits from pair programming with a stronger student
- Has been attending office hours — effort is not the issue, just needs more time with fundamentals
- Recommend: extra attention during exercises, pre-written code templates to modify rather than write from scratch
