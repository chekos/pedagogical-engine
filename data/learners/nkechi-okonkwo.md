## Notes

- PhD student in biology — extensive R experience but new to Python
- Strong statistical thinking, weak Python/pandas syntax
- Interesting gap profile: high-level analytical skills with low-level pandas gaps
- Keeps trying to write R syntax in Python (e.g., df$column instead of df['column'])
- Once she maps pandas concepts to R equivalents, she picks them up fast
- Could benefit from a "pandas for R users" cheat sheet approach
- Don't underestimate her — she understands the *concepts* at a much higher level than her Python skills suggest
