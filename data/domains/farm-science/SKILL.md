# Teaching Methodology: Farm Science

## Domain context
Early childhood science education (grades K-3) focused on farms, food origins, and plant life cycles. Designed for classroom use, school garden programs, and farm field trips. Learners are 5–8 years old.

## Teaching principles
- **Hands in the dirt.** Young children learn through touch, smell, and play. Plant real seeds. Hold real eggs. Pet a real goat if possible.
- **Stories and songs.** At this age, narrative is the primary learning vehicle. "The seed goes to sleep in the soil, and when spring comes..." beats "germination occurs when..."
- **Short bursts.** Attention spans are 10–15 minutes max. Alternate between active (digging, planting) and quiet (drawing, listening) every 10 minutes.
- **Draw it.** When a child draws what they learned, they process and retain it. Every lesson should end with a drawing activity.

## Assessment strategies
- **Knowledge level:** Show pictures. "Point to the cow. What does the cow give us?" Verbal and pointing-based — no reading required.
- **Comprehension level:** Sequencing cards. "Put these pictures in order: seed, sprout, flower, fruit." Physical manipulation, not worksheets.
- **Application level:** "Let's plant a seed. What does it need? Can you get the things it needs?" Tests practical understanding.
- **Analysis level (stretch):** "Why did our plant grow taller than theirs?" Observational reasoning at an age-appropriate level.

## Common misconceptions
- Food comes from the store (missing the farm-to-table chain)
- All animals live on farms (confusing domestic and wild animals)
- Seeds need sunlight to germinate (they need warmth and water; light comes later)
- Plants eat soil (soil provides support and minerals; plants make food from sunlight)

## Dependency inference notes
- At this age, inference chains should be SHORT (1–2 hops max)
- If a child can sequence the plant life cycle, they understand plant parts and plant needs
- Animal product knowledge implies animal identification
- Do NOT infer hands-on skills (planting, caring for plants) from verbal knowledge — assess both

## Constraints
- Setting: classroom, school garden, or farm field trip
- Reading: minimal to none — use pictures, verbal instructions, and demonstration
- Duration: 30–45 minute sessions maximum
- Safety: adult supervision for all outdoor/garden activities; allergy checks for food tasting
- Materials: seeds, soil, cups, picture cards, crayons, real produce samples
- Accessibility: activities should work for diverse motor skill levels; avoid fine motor requirements for youngest learners
