# Teaching Notes: python-data-analysis

Observational notes from post-session debriefs. These inform future lesson composition.

- **[2026-02-13]** (what_worked) pandas-groupby: The "what's the average price PER category?" bridge question is highly effective. Use it as the standard hook for introducing groupby.
- **[2026-02-13]** (what_worked) select-filter-data: Starting with a warm-up on select/filter before groupby builds essential confidence, especially for beginners.
- **[2026-02-13]** (what_struggled) basic-plotting: Introducing matplotlib alongside groupby is too much cognitive load. Consider separating into two sessions or using only the DataFrame.plot API.
- **[2026-02-13]** (prerequisite_gap) basic-plotting: Screen reader compatibility with matplotlib chart output needs to be a documented prerequisite/workaround.
- **[2026-02-13]** (activity_idea) pandas-groupby: Add a deliberate "NaN in groupby columns" exercise to surface data quality issues early.
- **[2026-02-13]** (what_worked) pandas-groupby: Alex's "sticky notes" metaphor — use this as a teaching aid in future sessions.
