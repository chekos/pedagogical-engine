The skill graph shows 'distinguish-magical-realism-from-related-genres' as a prerequisite for 'recognize-magical-realism-in-passage,' but the dependency confidence is 0.8 (vs 0.9 for key-literary-devices-magical-realism). A brief aside during the definition section ('it is not fantasy, not surrealism') plants the conceptual seed without consuming a dedicated 8-10 minute segment. This frees time for the passage walkthrough, which is where the 'one thing' lives. Students will develop the full distinction throughout the AP course.",

(2) This is a guest speaker in an unfamiliar classroom -- students will be more reserved than usual. A pair-share with a neighbor (not the stranger) lowers the participation barrier. (3) The warm-up directly primes the core concept of magical realism ('real events that feel impossible') without using any literary vocabulary, creating a experiential bridge to the definition. Every student has an answer to this question -- it is impossible to fail.",

The first activity sets the participation norm for the session. If students are silent for the first 15 minutes, they will likely stay silent for the passage walkthrough."

The dependency chain is strict. Additionally, the group is new to magical realism (only Sergio has partial knowledge at 0.63 on the definition). For a group encountering a concept for the first time, a deductive approach (framework first, then application) is more reliable than an inductive approach (passage first, then extract the framework). The guest speaker format reinforces this: lecture-to-application is the natural shape for a guest talk with interactive elements.",

The devices are not intuitive enough to extract without scaffolding -- students might notice 'something strange happens' but would not identify 'matter-of-fact narration' or 'unresolved supernatural elements' as distinct devices.

In a 50-minute session with a guest speaker, the overhead of distributing, reading, and transitioning 5 times would consume too much time. One concentrated passage walkthrough is more efficient and creates a stronger 'aha' moment when students see multiple devices in a single text."

      "reasoning": "Three factors: (1) Guest speaker format -- the speaker does not have the relationship capital to assign independent analytical work and troubleshoot when students struggle. Guided analysis lets the speaker model the thinking process while inviting contributions at safe moments. (2) Affective context -- with no affective data on file and a confidence-building recommendation, speaker-led analysis eliminates the risk of students freezing on an unfamiliar task in front of a stranger. Students participate by responding to targeted questions, not by performing solo analysis. (3) Time -- independent analysis requires more time (students read at different speeds, some need hints, regrouping takes time). A guided walkthrough is more time-efficient for a 50-minute session.",

The speaker has no relationship to fall back on ('come on, we talked about this yesterday'). Also adds 5-7 minutes (reading time + pair discussion + share-out) that this session cannot afford."

For a brand-new concept, some students will not know where to start, and their partner may not either. The pair discussion becomes two confused people confirming each other's confusion. Guided walkthrough prevents this by giving every student at least one successful analytical pass through the text."

However, this session cannot afford that -- the passage walkthrough needs 12+ minutes and is the higher-priority activity. The compression to 10 minutes is made feasible by two strategies: (1) each device gets a vivid, concrete example from a well-known text, making the device memorable without extended explanation, and (2) the passage walkthrough will reinforce 3-4 of the 5 devices through applied recognition, effectively giving students a second pass. The plan explicitly includes a contingency: if running behind, cut devices 4 and 5 to one sentence each and let students encounter them in the passage.",

The safe default for an unknown speaker is specific alternatives -- they are usable by both improvisers and structuralists.

The matter-of-fact narration is also evident. This density of devices in a single short passage means the speaker can demonstrate the 3-question framework completely without needing to switch texts.
