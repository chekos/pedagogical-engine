- Does not like writing or drawing — needs alternative ways to demonstrate knowledge
- Potential: can teach other students tracking and field craft; gains confidence when he is the expert

- Consider letting him demonstrate skills verbally or through hands-on demonstration rather than written work
- Allergic to bee stings — carries an EpiPen; group must know location of his pack at all times
