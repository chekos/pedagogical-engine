## Inferred Skills

- use-jupyter: 0.56 confidence (inferred)

## Affective Profile

- **Confidence:** moderate-low in Python specifically — high in data analysis concepts from Excel. Frustration when accessibility barriers slow him down erodes confidence
- **Motivation:** intrinsic — wants to add Python to his professional toolkit. Excited about the possibilities but sometimes discouraged by the learning curve
- **Social dynamics:** quiet but engaged. Does not volunteer answers but contributes thoughtfully when asked. Works well independently; paired work is physically awkward due to screen magnification setup
- **Past experiences:** had a frustrating experience in a previous online Python tutorial that did not accommodate screen readers. Educator noted "he almost quit the course after session 1 but came back because the in-person format was better"
- **Comfort preferences:** prefers individual work with periodic check-ins. Uncomfortable with timed exercises or public coding — the pressure of being watched while his screen is magnified makes him self-conscious

## Notes

- Accessibility needs: visual impairment — uses screen magnification and high-contrast mode
- Prefers working in the terminal over Jupyter (screen reader works better)
- 15 years of Excel experience — strong data intuition, just needs Python syntax
- Tends to get frustrated when he can't see the data easily — encourage df.to_string() output
- Very strong at interpreting results once he can see them — the bottleneck is getting the code right
- Intermediate overall — solid fundamentals but gaps in pandas-specific operations
