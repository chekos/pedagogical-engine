## Assessed Skills

- open-terminal: 0.90 confidence — demonstrated at application level

  - Evidence: Knows several types and their uses but doesn't explain interactions between them
- python-control-flow: 0.75 confidence — demonstrated at application level

  - Evidence: Writes loops and conditionals but as separate constructs
- python-functions: 0.65 confidence — demonstrated at application level

- handle-missing-data: 0.60 confidence — demonstrated at knowledge level
  - solo_demonstrated: unistructural
  - Evidence: Knows about NaN but hasn't practiced cleanup strategies
- basic-plotting: 0.70 confidence — demonstrated at application level
  - solo_demonstrated: relational
  - Evidence: Tableau background means she connects visualization choices to data stories naturally
- interpret-distributions: 0.55 confidence — demonstrated at comprehension level
  - solo_demonstrated: relational
  - Evidence: Strong visual intuition from Tableau; connects distribution shape to data meaning

## Inferred Skills

- use-jupyter: 0.60 confidence (inferred)
- select-filter-data: 0.68 confidence (inferred)

## Affective Profile

- **Confidence:** moderate — confident with data concepts from Tableau but uncertain about "real coding." Sometimes prefixes answers with "this is probably wrong but..."
- **Motivation:** extrinsic (career advancement) + social — her manager suggested the course, but she's genuinely enjoying it and the group dynamic keeps her coming back
- **Social dynamics:** the social glue of the group. Asks questions others are thinking. Pairs well with Nkechi (similar intermediate level, complementary skills). Good rapport with Alex — encouraging without being patronizing
- **Past experiences:** no negative experiences, but has a "I'm not a programmer" self-identity that limits her confidence. Tableau proficiency hasn't fully translated to coding confidence
- **Comfort preferences:** thrives in collaborative settings. Prefers pair work over solo. Comfortable speaking up in class

## Notes

- Marketing analyst who uses Tableau daily — strong data visualization instincts
- Surprisingly weak on missing data handling despite strong plotting skills (gap in an unexpected place)
- Good at reading charts but hasn't connected that to writing code to generate them
- Asks great questions — benefits the whole class when she speaks up
- Intermediate level — solid foundations, needs to build pandas fluency
