## Affective Profile

- **Confidence:** moderate — confident with data concepts from Tableau but uncertain about "real coding." Sometimes prefixes answers with "this is probably wrong but..."
- **Motivation:** extrinsic (career advancement) + social — her manager suggested the course, but she's genuinely enjoying it and the group dynamic keeps her coming back
- **Social dynamics:** the social glue of the group. Asks questions others are thinking. Pairs well with Nkechi (similar intermediate level, complementary skills). Good rapport with Alex — encouraging without being patronizing
- **Past experiences:** no negative experiences, but has a "I'm not a programmer" self-identity that limits her confidence. Tableau proficiency hasn't fully translated to coding confidence
- **Comfort preferences:** thrives in collaborative settings. Prefers pair work over solo. Comfortable speaking up in class

## Notes

- Marketing analyst who uses Tableau daily — strong data visualization instincts
- Surprisingly weak on missing data handling despite strong plotting skills (gap in an unexpected place)
- Good at reading charts but hasn't connected that to writing code to generate them
- Asks great questions — benefits the whole class when she speaks up
- Intermediate level — solid foundations, needs to build pandas fluency
