## Affective Profile

- **Confidence:** high — deeply connected to natural environments, thrives outdoors
- **Motivation:** intrinsic — lifelong naturalist now pursuing environmental data science
- **Social dynamics:** collaborative leader, excellent at mentoring younger students in field settings
- **Past experiences:** positive — grew up on a reservation with strong connection to land and ecology
- **Comfort preferences:** prefers hands-on learning; patient with complex analysis; new to computers

## Notes

- Environmental science graduate now transitioning into data science for conservation work
- Exceptional field skills — 15+ years of practical ecology experience
- Strong analytical thinking developed through ecology: can analyze habitat health, compare ecosystems, interpret seasonal patterns
- Now wants to learn Python to analyze ecological datasets programmatically
- Perfect candidate for cross-domain transfer: her analysis/synthesis/evaluation skills from ecology should give her a head start in data analysis
- Has never used a terminal or written code before — domain-specific Python skills won't transfer, but her scientific thinking will
