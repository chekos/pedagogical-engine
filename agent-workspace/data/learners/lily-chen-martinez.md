- Parents want her to learn knife skills and stovetop cooking with proper supervision
- Very detail-oriented and follows instructions carefully — the kind of student who reads the whole recipe first
- Adventurous palate — eats cuisines from both Chinese and Mexican family traditions
- Math is strong — recipe scaling comes naturally to her
- Primary concern: age-appropriate knife and heat safety — go slow, supervise closely
- Younger siblings (ages 7 and 5) sometimes join the class and need separate simple tasks
