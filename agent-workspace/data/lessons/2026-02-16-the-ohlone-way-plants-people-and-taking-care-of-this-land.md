# Lesson Plan: The Ohlone Way: Plants, People, and Taking Care of This Land

**Prepared for:** Sergio
**Date:** 2026-02-16
**Domain:** Ohlone Ethnobotany and Stewardship

---

## Session Overview

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Topic** | Ohlone ethnobotany and stewardship -- a walking lesson through Tilden Nature Area |
| **Audience** | 20 third graders (ages 8-9) with 4-5 adult chaperones |
| **Setting** | Outdoor trail walk: Environmental Education Center to Jewel Lake and back |
| **Duration** | 50 minutes |
| **The one thing** | The Ohlone peoples have been here for thousands of years and they are STILL here. The reason we can enjoy this nature today is because they took care of it. If we want people in the future to enjoy nature, we need to take care of it today. |

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, students will be able to:

1. Identify bay laurel, mugwort, soap root, and oak by sight, smell, or touch *(Bloom's: Knowledge)*
2. State that the Ohlone peoples have lived in the East Bay for thousands of years and are still here today *(Bloom's: Knowledge)*
3. Name at least one way the Ohlone used each plant -- food, medicine, cleaning, or cooking *(Bloom's: Knowledge)*
4. Explain that the Ohlone did not just use plants but cared for and managed them *(Bloom's: Comprehension)*
5. Describe stewardship as taking care of something so it is there for the future *(Bloom's: Comprehension)*
6. Give an example of Ohlone people or culture today *(Bloom's: Application)*
7. Describe one thing they can personally do to take care of nature *(Bloom's: Application)*

### How Skills Layer Across This Lesson

This is not a one-skill-per-stop plan. The knowledge skills (plant identification, Ohlone presence, plant uses) build simultaneously at every plant stop, layering on top of each other. The comprehension skills (plant-people relationship, stewardship) crystallize at the oak stop where Ohlone land management becomes concrete. The application skills (contemporary connections, personal stewardship) land in the closing circle at Jewel Lake. Each stop adds weight to the cumulative understanding.

### A Note on Scope

The tension analysis flagged 7 skills in 50 minutes as over-scoped. In a classroom setting with isolated instruction, that would be correct. But this lesson uses layered experiential design: the three knowledge-level skills are woven into every plant stop simultaneously rather than taught one at a time. The comprehension skills emerge naturally from the oak stop narrative. The application skills are addressed in the structured closing. This structure is pedagogically appropriate for outdoor education with young learners -- experiential layering is how field teaching works.

## Prerequisites Checklist

### For Students (before the trip)

- [ ] **Dress for the trail**
  - How: Teacher sends home a note at least 2 days prior: closed-toe shoes, layers, sun protection. No sandals or flip-flops.
  - Verify: Visual check at the bus. Have 2-3 spare pairs of basic sneakers in assorted sizes if possible.

- [ ] **Basic Ohlone awareness (recommended, not required)**
  - How: Classroom teacher reads one picture book or has a brief conversation about Indigenous peoples of the Bay Area. Suggested: *When We Were Alone* by David A. Robertson (general Indigenous themes, age-appropriate) or a brief mention: "The land where we live has been home to the Ohlone people for a very long time."
  - Verify: Ask the classroom teacher if this happened. If not, Sergio will cover it in the opening -- it just takes 30 seconds longer.

- [ ] **Trail behavior expectations (recommended)**
  - How: Classroom teacher reviews before loading the bus: stay on trail, stay with your group, hands to yourself unless the naturalist says otherwise.
  - Verify: Sergio will reinforce at the trailhead regardless.

### For Chaperones (briefed at arrival)

- [ ] **Chaperone role briefing (3 minutes at arrival, before kids exit bus)**
  - How: Sergio briefs chaperones on their role (see Chaperone Instructions below).
  - Verify: Each chaperone knows which group of 4-5 kids they are responsible for and understands their job at each stop.

### Materials (Sergio carries)

| Item | Purpose | Backup |
|---|---|---|
| 1 acorn (or a few) | Pass-around at oak stop | Look for one on the ground at the oak stop |
| 1 soap root bulb with fibrous husk (if available) | Show the "brush" and "soap" at soap root stop | Describe and point to the plant; the visual is still powerful |
| Small spray bottle of water (optional) | Wet the soap root fibers to show lather | Skip if unavailable -- describe the lather instead |
| Nothing else | This lesson runs on plants in the ground and words in your mouth | -- |

## Chaperone Instructions

Brief chaperones BEFORE the kids get off the bus or at the trailhead. This takes 3 minutes. Say something like:

> "Thanks for being here. Here is how today works. I will lead the group on the trail and we will stop at four plants. At each stop, I need you to do three things: (1) Keep your group of 4-5 kids together and near the front so everyone can see and hear. (2) If a kid is distracted or wandering, quietly redirect them -- do not wait for me to notice. (3) At the last stop by the lake, I will ask kids to turn to a partner and share. Help make sure every kid in your group has a partner and is actually talking, not just standing there. You do not need to teach anything. Just keep them safe, close, and engaged."

Assign groups right there. Each chaperone gets 4-5 kids. If you have exactly 4 chaperones for 20 kids, that is 5 per group. Write the group assignments on a sticky note or index card for each chaperone if you can.

## Timed Session Plan

---

### Phase 1: Arrival and Opening

**[0:00-0:04] Opening at the Trailhead -- "Whose Land Is This?" (4 min)**

You: Gather the group in a semicircle at the trailhead. Stand where everyone can see you. Wait for quiet -- do not start talking over chatter. When you have their attention, start with a hook.

Suggested opening -- adapt this to your voice:

> "Before we take a single step on this trail, I want to tell you something. This land has a name. Not Tilden -- that is a newer name. The Ohlone people, who have lived right here, right where you are standing, for thousands and thousands of years -- they called this area Huchiun."

Pause. Let the word land.

> "And here is the really important part. The Ohlone are not gone. They are still here. They live in Oakland, in Berkeley, all around the East Bay. And today we are going to walk this trail and meet four plants that the Ohlone have known and taken care of for longer than any of us can imagine."

Then set expectations:

> "Here is how our walk works. We are going to stop four times to meet four plants. At every stop, you can touch, you can smell -- but only when I say it is okay. Stay with your chaperone group. Stay on the trail. And here is my one big ask: when we stop, come in close so everyone can see and hear. Deal?"

Get a verbal "deal" or thumbs up. This matters -- it is a social contract, not just instructions.

Students: Listening, settling into the idea that this is going to be interactive, not a lecture.

Watch for: Kids who are already distracted or anxious. Make eye contact with them specifically during the "deal?" moment. If the group is buzzy after a bus ride, add one physical reset: "Everybody shake your hands out. Okay. Now we are ready."

Time check: You MUST be walking by 0:04. If the opening is dragging, cut the Huchiun detail and just say: "This land belongs to the Ohlone people, and they are still here. Let's go meet the plants they know."

Chaperones: Standing with their groups. Quietly redirecting kids who are poking each other or not facing Sergio.

---

### Phase 2: Plant Stop 1 -- Bay Laurel

**[0:04-0:05] Transition: Walk to Bay Laurel (1 min)**

You: Start walking. As you walk, keep energy up: "Our first plant is just up ahead. I want you to use one of your senses -- not your eyes. I will tell you which one when we get there."

This builds anticipation. Eight-year-olds walk faster when they are curious.

**[0:05-0:12] Plant Stop 1: Bay Laurel (7 min)**

You: Stop at the bay laurel. Gather the group in close -- half-circle, everyone within arm's reach of the plant.

Step 1 -- Sensory hook (2 min):
Pick a leaf (or have one ready). Hold it up.

> "This is called bay laurel. But before I tell you anything else about it, I want you to smell it."

Carefully tear the leaf to release the scent. Pass it around (or tear several leaves and hand them to chaperones to pass within groups).

> "What does it smell like to you?"

Let 3-4 kids answer. You will hear "pizza," "soup," "my grandma's kitchen," "medicine." All of these are correct.

> "Some of you said it smells like cooking. That is exactly right. If your family cooks with bay leaves -- the ones you find in soup or pasta sauce -- this is where they come from. This exact kind of tree."

Anticipated student questions:
- "Can we eat it?" -- "You would not eat the leaf itself, but you put it in food while it cooks to add flavor, then take it out. Like a tea bag for soup."
- "Is it the same as the ones at the store?" -- "Very close. The ones at the store might be from a related tree, but the Ohlone used this exact one."

Step 2 -- Ohlone connection (2 min):

> "Now here is what I want you to think about. The Ohlone people knew this plant really, really well. They used these leaves for cooking, just like some of your families do. But they also used it as medicine. If you had a headache or a stomachache, bay laurel leaves could help."

Socratic question:

> "How do you think the Ohlone figured out that this plant could help a headache? Do you think someone just guessed one day?"

Let 2-3 kids respond. Guide toward: they paid attention to the plants around them for a very long time. They learned from their parents and grandparents, who learned from their parents and grandparents.

> "That is thousands of years of paying attention to nature. That is a LOT of knowledge."

Step 3 -- Plant ID anchor (1 min):

> "So how will you recognize bay laurel if you see it again? Two things: the leaves are smooth and kind of pointy" -- hold one up -- "and that smell. You will never forget that smell."

Watch for: Kids who do not want to smell the leaf (sensory sensitivity). Do not force it. Say "That is fine -- you can just look at it. What do you notice about the shape?" Kids who try to eat the leaf -- redirect calmly: "We smell, we do not taste on the trail."

Time check: By 0:10, you should be wrapping the Ohlone connection. If the smell-and-share took longer than expected, shorten the Socratic question to a single prompt and answer it yourself: "They learned from thousands of years of watching and teaching each other."

Chaperones: Help pass leaves within their groups. Make sure every kid gets a turn to smell. Gently redirect any kid who wanders away from the circle.

---

### Phase 3: Plant Stop 2 -- Mugwort

**[0:12-0:13] Transition: Walk to Mugwort (1 min)**

You: As you walk:

> "Okay, that was bay laurel -- cooking and medicine. Our next plant is very different. This one has a secret hiding on the back of its leaves."

**[0:13-0:20] Plant Stop 2: Mugwort (7 min)**

You: Stop at mugwort. Gather in close.

Step 1 -- Sensory hook (2 min):

> "This is mugwort. Look at the top of the leaf -- what color is it?"

("Green.")

> "Now flip it over. What do you see on the bottom?"

Let them look. The underside is silvery-white and soft.

> "Touch the bottom of the leaf -- gently. What does it feel like?"

You will hear "soft," "fuzzy," "like felt." Let chaperones hold stems low so kids can touch the undersides.

> "That silvery fuzz is how you will always know mugwort. Green on top, silver on the bottom."

Step 2 -- Ohlone connection (2 min):

> "The Ohlone used mugwort for medicine. If you had sore muscles or a rash, mugwort could help. They also burned dried mugwort for ceremony -- the smoke was important in their spiritual practices. And some people say it helps you have vivid dreams."

Socratic question:

> "We have looked at two plants now -- bay laurel and mugwort. The Ohlone used both of them for medicine. What does that tell you about how much the Ohlone knew about the plants around them?"

Guide toward: they did not just walk past these plants. They really knew them. They knew what each one could do.

> "It is like the Ohlone had a whole pharmacy right here on this trail -- but instead of a building with bottles, it was living, growing all around them."

Anticipated student questions:
- "Can mugwort really make you dream?" -- "Some people believe that. The Ohlone thought mugwort was very powerful, not just for the body but for the mind and spirit too."
- "Why does it have fuzz?" -- "Great question. The fuzz actually helps the plant survive. It keeps it from losing too much water when it is hot and dry."
- "Can I take some home?" -- "Let's leave it here so the next group and the next group after them can see it too. That is actually going to be a big idea today -- leaving things for the people who come after us."

Step 3 -- Pattern reinforcement (1 min):

> "So now we know two Ohlone plants. Bay laurel -- cooking and medicine. Mugwort -- medicine, ceremony, and dreams. What do you think our next plant will be used for?"

Let a few kids guess. It does not matter what they say. The point is they are now expecting a pattern: every plant has a purpose the Ohlone knew about. That pattern is doing the teaching.

Watch for: Kids who pull entire plants or break stems. Redirect immediately but gently: "We just need to touch one leaf -- the plant stays in the ground." If a kid seems bored or disengaged, give them a specific task: "Can you be the one who finds the silver side?"

Time check: By 0:18, you should be into the pattern reinforcement. If you are behind, skip the dream detail and the pharmacy metaphor. Go straight from "medicine and ceremony" to "What do you think the next plant will be used for?"

Chaperones: Hold stems down for shorter kids. Watch for pulling or breaking.

### Phase 4: Plant Stop 3 -- Soap Root

**[0:20-0:21] Transition: Walk to Soap Root (1 min)**

You: As you walk:

> "Okay -- this next plant is my favorite. It might be the most surprising plant on this whole trail. When we get there, I am going to ask you to look at it and tell me what you think it was used for."

**[0:21-0:29] Plant Stop 3: Soap Root (8 min)**

This is the "wow" stop. Give it the full 8 minutes if you have them.

You: Stop at the soap root. If you have a bulb to show, hold it up. If not, point to the plant and describe the bulb underground.

Step 1 -- Sensory hook and guessing game (3 min):

> "This is called soap root. But forget the name for a second -- just look at it."

If you have the bulb:

> "Look at this. It has a brown, hairy outside -- those are fibers. And inside, there is a white bulb."

Pass it around or hold it where everyone can see.

> "Okay -- what do you think the Ohlone used this for? I will give you a hint: it is not just one thing. The Ohlone found FOUR different uses for this one plant."

Let kids guess. Write mental notes on their guesses -- some will be wildly creative and that is great.

Then reveal one at a time:

> "Number one: SOAP." (If you have the spray bottle, wet the fibers and rub -- they will lather slightly. If not, describe it.) "If you rub the bulb with water, it makes suds. The Ohlone used it to wash things -- kind of like the original biodegradable soap."

> "Number two: GLUE. The sticky juice inside could be used like paste. Think about that -- glue from a plant."

> "Number three: A BRUSH. See these fibers on the outside? The Ohlone bundled them up and used them as a brush."

> "Number four: FOOD. If you cook the bulb for a long time -- and I mean a long time -- you can eat it. But you cannot eat it raw. The Ohlone knew exactly how to prepare it."

Step 2 -- The big idea (2 min):

This is where you start building toward stewardship. Slow down here.

> "I want you to think about something. One plant -- four uses. Soap, glue, a brush, and food. The Ohlone looked at this plant and they saw ALL of that."

Socratic question:

> "How do you think you get that smart about a plant? How do you figure out that one plant can do four different things?"

Guide toward: you have to spend a really long time paying attention. And you have to teach your children what you know, so they can teach their children.

> "That is thousands of years of knowledge, passed down from grandparents to parents to kids, just like you. The Ohlone did not just walk through nature. They UNDERSTOOD nature -- better than almost anyone."

Anticipated student questions:
- "Why can't you eat it raw?" -- "The raw bulb has stuff in it that would make your stomach hurt. Cooking it for a long time breaks that down. The Ohlone figured that out and taught each other how to do it safely."
- "Can we make soap with it right now?" -- "I wish! We would need water and time to really get it going. But you can see the fibers that would make the suds." (If you have the spray bottle, this is a good moment to demo.)
- "Did they have real soap too?" -- "This WAS real soap to them. It worked great. The idea that soap has to come from a store is actually pretty new."

Step 3 -- Quick ID anchor (1 min):

> "Soap root -- look for long, wavy leaves close to the ground, and if you could dig underneath, you would find that hairy bulb. But we are going to leave it right where it is."

Watch for: This is often the highest-energy stop because the "four uses" reveal is surprising. Channel the energy, do not suppress it. If kids are excited and talking to each other, let it run for 15-20 seconds before pulling focus back. Excitement means they are learning. If a kid wants to dig up the plant, redirect firmly but without shaming: "I know -- I wanted to dig one up too the first time. But if we did, there would not be any left for the next group. We are going to talk about that idea at our last stop."

Time check: By 0:27, you should be wrapping the big idea. If you are behind, skip "Number two: GLUE" and "Number three: A BRUSH" -- soap and food are the most important. You can mention the others in passing: "And believe it or not, the Ohlone also used it as glue and a brush."

Chaperones: Help pass the bulb if Sergio has one. Keep kids from grabbing or digging.

### Phase 5: Plant Stop 4 -- Oak and Acorns

**[0:29-0:30] Transition: Walk to Oak (1 min)**

You: As you walk:

> "Our last plant is one you already know. But I bet you do not know the most important thing about it."

**[0:30-0:38] Plant Stop 4: Oak / Acorns -- "The Ohlone Took Care of This Land" (8 min)**

This is the most important stop. This is where identification, uses, and the relationship between people and plants all come together. The comprehension-level skills (explain-plant-people-relationship, describe-stewardship) crystallize here.

You: Stop at an oak tree. If there are acorns on the ground, pick one up. If you brought one, hold it up.

Step 1 -- The familiar made unfamiliar (2 min):

> "You all know what this is, right?"

("An oak tree." / "Acorns.")

> "Right. Oak trees, acorns. You see them everywhere. You probably kick acorns on the sidewalk. But for the Ohlone, acorns were not just something on the ground. Acorns were their most important food. The number one thing they ate."

Pass the acorn around.

> "But here is the thing -- you cannot just eat an acorn. If you bit into this right now, it would taste TERRIBLE. Super bitter. The Ohlone had to do a whole process: they cracked the shells, ground the insides into flour, and then washed the flour with water over and over and over to get the bitter taste out. That is called leaching."

Socratic question:

> "Why would you go through all that work for one food? Why not just eat something easier?"

Guide toward: because acorns were everywhere, they stored well, and they were nutritious. The Ohlone figured out how to turn something bitter and hard into something that fed everyone. That takes incredible knowledge and patience.

Step 2 -- Stewardship becomes concrete (3 min):

This is the key pivot. Slow down. Lower your voice slightly -- it signals "this is important."

> "Now here is the part most people do not know. The Ohlone did not just find oak trees and take the acorns. They took care of the oak trees so the trees would keep making acorns."

> "The Ohlone used controlled burns -- they set small, careful fires on purpose. Not to destroy anything. The fires cleared out the brush and the dead stuff on the ground, which meant the oak trees had more room to grow, more sunlight, fewer pests. After a burn, the oak trees produced MORE acorns. The land was healthier."

Socratic question:

> "Does that sound like someone who just uses nature? Or does that sound like someone who takes CARE of nature?"

Let kids respond. You are looking for the lightbulb: the Ohlone were not just taking from the land. They were managing it. Giving back. Making sure it kept working.

> "This is what I want you to remember more than anything else today. The Ohlone did not just use plants. They took CARE of the plants. They managed this land so it would be healthy for their children, and their children's children. The nature you see right now -- these trees, this trail, this whole place -- it looks like this partly because the Ohlone took care of it for thousands of years."

Step 3 -- Name the concept (1 min):

> "There is a word for what the Ohlone did. The word is STEWARDSHIP."

Say it clearly. Have the kids repeat it.

> "Stewardship means taking care of something so it will be there for the people who come after you. The Ohlone were stewards of this land. Say it with me: stewardship."

Have them say it once together.

Anticipated student questions:
- "Do people still do controlled burns?" -- "Yes! In fact, scientists now agree that the way the Ohlone managed the land with fire was really smart. Some parks are starting to do controlled burns again because they realized the Ohlone were right all along."
- "Why did they stop?" -- This is a sensitive question. Keep it simple and honest: "When European settlers came to this area, they told the Ohlone they could not manage the land the way they always had. A lot of things changed for the Ohlone that were not fair. But the Ohlone are still here, and they are still fighting to take care of this land. We are going to talk about that at our last stop."
- "Could the fire burn down the whole forest?" -- "The Ohlone were incredibly skilled at controlling the fires. They knew exactly when and where to burn. It was not wild -- it was careful and planned, like a gardener pruning a tree."

Watch for: This is a lot of information. Watch kids' body language. If they are fidgeting, shifting weight, looking away -- you are losing them. Cut to "stewardship" immediately: name the concept, have them say it, and move to the closing. The concept is more important than the details. If kids seem deeply engaged and are asking questions, let it run a minute or two longer -- this is the heart of the lesson, and their curiosity here is gold.

Time check: By 0:36, you MUST be saying the word "stewardship." If you are not there yet, skip the controlled burns detail entirely and go straight from "They took care of the oak trees" to "That is called stewardship." You can mention burns at the lake if there is time. Protecting the closing is more important than completing this stop.

Chaperones: This is the longest and most content-heavy stop. Watch for kids in the back who cannot hear. Gently nudge them forward.

---

### Phase 6: Closing at Jewel Lake

**[0:38-0:39] Transition: Walk to Jewel Lake gathering spot (1 min)**

You: Walk briskly to the lake. As you walk:

> "We have one more stop -- the most important one. And this time, YOU are going to do the talking."

**[0:39-0:50] Closing Circle at Jewel Lake (11 min)**

This is the most important part of the lesson. The application-level skills live here. Protect this time above all else. If you had to cut everything short to get here by 0:39, it was worth it.

You: Find a spot where the group can sit or stand in a rough circle. Sitting is better if the ground is dry -- it settles energy and signals "this is different."

Step 1 -- Quick review and bridge to present (3 min):

> "Okay. We met four plants today. Let's see if you remember."

Quick-fire review -- point to fingers as you count:

> "Bay laurel -- what was it used for?" (Cooking, medicine.)
> "Mugwort?" (Medicine, ceremony, dreams.)
> "Soap root?" (Soap, glue, brush, food.)
> "And the big one -- oak and acorns?" (Food -- their most important food. And they took care of the oak trees.)

> "And we learned a word. What was it?"

(Stewardship.)

> "Right. Stewardship. Taking care of something so it will be there for the future."

Now the bridge to present -- this is where it gets real:

> "So I told you at the beginning that the Ohlone are still here. I meant it. Let me tell you about two things that are happening RIGHT NOW."

> "There is an organization called Sogorea Te' Land Trust. It is led by Ohlone people, right here in the East Bay. They are getting land back -- actual pieces of land -- and putting them under Indigenous care again. The same kind of care the Ohlone have always practiced. Stewardship."

> "And there is a place in Berkeley called Cafe Ohlone, run by a man named Vincent Medina, who is Ohlone. You can go there and eat traditional Ohlone foods -- foods made from the same plants and animals the Ohlone have been eating for thousands of years. Acorn dishes. Bay laurel. It is real. You could go there."

Pause. Let that land.

> "The Ohlone are not just in a history book. They are your neighbors. They are doing this work right now."

Anticipated student questions:
- "Can we go to Cafe Ohlone?" -- "You absolutely can. It is in Berkeley. Maybe your teacher or your family could take you."
- "Where is the land trust?" -- "They have land in several places around the East Bay. You can look up Sogorea Te' Land Trust -- their website shows where."
- "Are there Ohlone kids at our school?" -- "There might be! The Ohlone community is not always visible in the way you might expect, but they are part of our community."

Step 2 -- Partner share: "What can YOU do?" (4 min):

> "Okay. Last question, and this one is about YOU."

> "The Ohlone took care of this land for thousands of years so it would be here for the future. Sogorea Te' Land Trust is doing it right now. Stewardship."

> "So here is my question: What is one thing YOU can do to take care of nature for the people who come after you?"

> "Turn to a partner -- the person next to you -- and tell them one thing you can do. It does not have to be big. It can be something you do at home, at school, or right here in the park."

Give them 90 seconds to talk. Signal chaperones to help pair up anyone who is standing alone. Walk around and listen -- you are gathering responses to use in the whole-group share.

Watch for: Kids who just stare at each other. Prompt them: "It could be something like picking up trash, or planting something, or not wasting water. What sounds right to you?" Kids who finish in 10 seconds -- ask a follow-up: "Why that one? Who would it help in the future?"

Chaperones: THIS IS YOUR MOMENT. Make sure every kid has a partner. If there is an odd number, a chaperone joins as a partner. Listen for kids who are stuck and give them a nudge.

Step 3 -- Whole group share and closing (3 min):

> "Okay, come back together. Who wants to share what they told their partner?"

Take 3-5 responses. Affirm each one genuinely. Connect them back:

> "I heard someone say [example]. That is stewardship."
> "[Another example] -- that is exactly what the Ohlone have been doing for thousands of years. You are carrying that forward."

Close with something from the heart. Here is a frame you can adapt:

> "The Ohlone took care of this land for thousands of years. They are still taking care of it. And now you know four of the plants they knew, and you know the word stewardship. Every time you walk on a trail or see an oak tree or smell bay laurel, I want you to remember: someone took care of this so you could be here today. And now it is your turn."

Pause. Do not rush the ending. Then:

> "Thank you for being such great listeners and thinkers today. Let's head back."

Watch for: If kids are restless and the circle is falling apart, skip the whole-group share. The partner share IS the learning moment -- the whole-group share is a bonus. Do not let it become crowd control. End strong: "I heard amazing ideas from you today. The Ohlone would be proud. Let's go."

Time check: You MUST start the partner share by 0:43 at the latest. If it is 0:43 and you have not started the partner share, stop whatever you are doing and go straight to: "Here is my question: what is one thing YOU can do?" The partner share and closing are non-negotiable -- they are where the application skills live.

## Contingency Notes

### If you are running behind at the 30-minute mark

If you reach the oak stop after 0:32, you are behind. Here is what to cut:

1. **At the oak stop:** Skip the controlled burns detail. Go straight from "They took care of the oak trees" to "That is called stewardship." You save 2-3 minutes.
2. **At the closing:** Skip the quick-fire review. The kids remember more than you think. Go straight to the contemporary connections (Sogorea Te', Cafe Ohlone) and then the partner share.
3. **Nuclear option:** If it is 0:38 and you are still at the oak stop, say the word "stewardship," have them repeat it, and walk directly to the lake. Do the contemporary connections AND the partner share at the lake. You will lose depth on the oak stop but save the closing, which matters more.

### If kids are restless or unfocused at a plant stop

This is normal for 8-year-olds, especially outdoors. Open-ended pivots:

- **Give them a job.** "I need a helper. Who can find me another bay laurel leaf?" Physical movement resets attention.
- **Speed up.** If the group energy is bouncing, shorten the stop. Hit the sensory hook, say one sentence about Ohlone use, and move on. You can add depth at the closing.
- **Use the "I notice" redirect.** "I notice some friends are looking at the creek instead of the mugwort. The creek IS cool -- and actually, the Ohlone knew this creek too. But right now, come look at this leaf."
- **Do NOT lecture about behavior.** A behavior lecture burns more time than the distraction itself. Redirect with curiosity, not discipline.

### If a kid asks a question you do not know the answer to

This will happen. Sergio, you know a lot, but eight-year-olds ask things nobody expects.

> "That is a great question, and I actually do not know the answer. But I love that you are thinking about that. Let's both try to find out."

Model not-knowing as a strength, not a weakness. This is also a stewardship teaching moment: the Ohlone built knowledge over generations. No one person knows everything.

### If it rains

Light rain: proceed with the lesson. Kids do not melt. Rain actually makes the bay laurel and mugwort MORE aromatic. Mention this: "Smell how much stronger the bay laurel is in the rain? That is because the water releases the oils in the leaf."

Heavy rain: move to the covered area near the Environmental Education Center. Adapt the lesson as a "virtual walk" -- describe each plant, show the soap root bulb if you have it, and focus heavily on the Ohlone narrative, contemporary connections, and stewardship challenge. You lose the sensory hooks but keep the core message.

### If a chaperone starts "helping" by lecturing or correcting

Some chaperones want to teach. Gently reclaim the space:

> "Thank you -- great point! So building on that..."

Redirect back to the Socratic approach. Do not correct the chaperone publicly. If it becomes a pattern, catch them at a transition: "I love your enthusiasm. The way this works best is if I lead the content and you help manage the kids. You are doing a great job with that."

### If a kid says something insensitive about Indigenous people

This can happen, usually from ignorance rather than malice with third graders. Respond calmly and directly:

> "Actually, let me share something about that. The Ohlone are real people who are alive today, and they are really proud of their culture. [Correct the specific misconception.] It is important that we talk about them with respect."

Do not shame the kid. The other children are watching how you handle it -- your calm, clear correction teaches the whole group.

## What to Cut If You Are Short on Time

Ranked from first-to-cut to last-to-cut:

1. **Cut first: Controlled burns detail at oak stop.** The stewardship concept survives without the mechanism. Save 2-3 min.
2. **Cut second: Pattern reinforcement at mugwort** ("What do you think the next plant will be used for?"). Nice but not essential. Save 1 min.
3. **Cut third: Glue and brush uses of soap root.** Keep soap and food -- those are the "wow" moments. Save 1 min.
4. **Cut fourth: Whole-group share at closing.** The partner share IS the learning. The whole-group share is a bonus. Save 2-3 min.
5. **Cut fifth: Quick-fire review at closing.** Go straight to contemporary connections. Save 1-2 min.
6. **NEVER cut: The partner share.** This is where apply-stewardship-personally lives. It is the learning objective that makes this lesson personal. Protect it.
7. **NEVER cut: Contemporary Ohlone connections.** Sogorea Te' Land Trust and Cafe Ohlone are what make the Ohlone present, not past. Without them, the lesson is history. With them, it is alive.

## Educator Profile Applied

This plan was customized for Sergio based on his educator profile:

- **Activity weighting:** Hands-on sensory engagement (smell, touch, hold) at every stop, Socratic questions as the primary teaching method, discussion woven into transitions and the closing. No lecture segments -- every "content" moment is framed as a conversation between Sergio and the kids.
- **Content scaffolding:** Detailed -- full talking points with suggested phrasing at every beat. Sergio is a strong improviser who will adapt these in the moment, but the full scaffolding is here so nothing gets forgotten on a busy trail with 20 eight-year-olds. Anticipated student questions and suggested responses are included at every stop.
- **Contingency style:** Open-ended pivots throughout. No rigid "switch to exercise B" instructions -- instead, flexible redirects that trust Sergio's ability to read the room and adapt. ("If kids are restless, give them a job." "If you are running behind, skip this detail and go straight to the concept.")
- **Lesson opening:** Story hook, as preferred. The opening is a narrative moment, not an agenda overview.
- **Strengths leveraged:** Rapport building (the "deal?" social contract, the calm handling of tough questions), facilitation (chaperone coordination, partner share management), improvisation (open-ended contingencies that give Sergio room to riff).

## Assessment Note

This group of 20 third graders has no prior assessment data in the ohlone-ethnobotany domain, which is expected -- this lesson IS the introduction. All 7 skills are taught from scratch within the session. The knowledge-level skills (plant identification, Ohlone presence, plant uses) are layered across all four plant stops rather than taught in isolation. The comprehension-level skills (plant-people relationship, stewardship) crystallize at the oak stop. The application-level skills (contemporary connections, personal stewardship) are developed in the closing circle. The dependency chain in the skill graph is respected by this trail structure.

If Sergio wants to assess retention after this session, the simplest approach is a classroom follow-up where the teacher asks: "What plants did we see? What did the Ohlone use them for? What does stewardship mean? What is one thing you can do?" These four questions cover all seven skills.
