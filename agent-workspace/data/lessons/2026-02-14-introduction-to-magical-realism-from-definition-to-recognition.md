# Lesson Plan: Introduction to Magical Realism: From Definition to Recognition

**Prepared for:** Guest Speaker (Mr. Sanchez's AP Spanish Literature class)
**Date:** February 2026
**Domain:** Spanish Literature

---

## Session Overview

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Topic** | Magical realism in Latin American literature -- definition, key literary devices, and passage recognition |
| **Audience** | AP Spanish Literature class (approx. 15-25 students), early in the school year |
| **Setting** | Classroom with projector and printed passages |
| **Duration** | 50 minutes |
| **The one thing** | Students should leave being able to look at a passage and identify whether magical realism is present and point to specific textual evidence for why. |

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, students will be able to:

1. Define magical realism and articulate how it differs from fantasy and surrealism *(Bloom's: knowledge)*
2. Identify the key literary devices that characterize magical realism -- matter-of-fact tone, mythic time, symbolic objects, sensory overload, unresolved supernatural elements *(Bloom's: comprehension)*
3. Recognize magical realism in a passage by pointing to specific textual evidence *(Bloom's: application)*

## Prerequisites Checklist

### For the Guest Speaker (you)

- [ ] **Coordinate with Mr. Sanchez before the session**
  - Confirm class size and seating arrangement
  - Ask if any students have accessibility needs you should know about
  - Request that Mr. Sanchez introduce you briefly (saves you 1-2 min of self-introduction awkwardness)
  - Ask for the projector connection type (HDMI, USB-C, etc.) and test it before class if possible

- [ ] **Prepare printed passages (2 passages, one per student)**
  - **Passage A (warm-up):** A short excerpt (8-12 lines) from Gabriel Garcia Marquez, "Un senor muy viejo con unas alas enormes" -- the opening paragraph where the old man with wings is discovered. Choose a passage where the magical element is embedded in mundane description.
  - **Passage B (guided walkthrough):** A short excerpt (10-15 lines) from Laura Esquivel, "Como agua para chocolate" -- a scene where Tita's cooking causes physical emotional reactions in everyone who eats. This is the passage students will analyze with you.
  - Print enough copies for every student plus 3 extras
  - Verify: You have a stack of Passage A and a separate stack of Passage B in hand before walking into the room

- [ ] **Prepare your projector slides (minimal -- 4-5 slides max)**
  - Slide 1: Your name, the session title, one evocative image (a Remedios Varo painting works well)
  - Slide 2: Definition of magical realism (text you will reveal piece by piece)
  - Slide 3: The 5 key devices (listed as headers, details you provide verbally)
  - Slide 4: "What is it NOT" -- one-liner contrasts with fantasy and surrealism
  - Slide 5: The passage analysis framework (3 questions students will use)
  - Verify: Slides display correctly on your laptop. Font is large enough to read from the back row.

- [ ] **Bring a backup**
  - USB drive with slides in case your laptop fails
  - If projector dies entirely, you can teach this session from printed passages alone -- the slides are a visual aid, not the content

### For Students (communicated via Mr. Sanchez beforehand)

- [ ] **No advance preparation required** -- this is a guest lecture, and the whole point is that magical realism is new territory. Come curious.

### Tool and Account Requirements

| Tool | Required? | Cost | Setup |
|---|---|---|---|
| Projector | Yes | N/A | Classroom equipment -- confirm with Mr. Sanchez |
| Printed passages (2 per student) | Yes | Printing cost | Guest speaker prepares and brings |
| Student laptops/devices | No | N/A | Not needed for this session |

## Timed Session Plan

### Phase 1 -- Arrival and Warm-Up

**[0:00-0:03] Opening -- Settle in and establish presence (3 min)**

You are a guest in someone else's classroom. The first 3 minutes determine whether students see you as an interesting person worth listening to or another adult talking at them.

Speaker: As students settle in, have your title slide up on the projector. Stand at the front but do not start talking yet -- let Mr. Sanchez introduce you. When he finishes, thank him, smile at the class, and say something like: "I'm here because I think magical realism is one of the most fascinating things happening in Latin American literature, and by the end of this period, you're going to be able to spot it in any passage someone puts in front of you."

That is your contract with them. One sentence. You just told them exactly what they are going to get.

Students: Settling in, sizing you up. This is normal.

Watch for: If Mr. Sanchez does not introduce you (maybe he forgot, maybe the culture is different), introduce yourself in two sentences max. Name, why you are here. Do not give your full biography -- they do not care yet. They will care after you show them something interesting.

**[0:03-0:08] Warm-up -- "What is the most surreal thing that has ever happened to you?" (5 min)**

This is the guaranteed-win exercise. Every student has an answer. Nobody can fail at this.

Speaker: Say: "Before we define anything, I want to hear from you. Think of the most surreal, unbelievable, or magical thing that has ever happened to you or someone in your family. Something that really happened but felt like it could not possibly be real. Turn to the person next to you and share it. You have 90 seconds."

Let them pair-share for 90 seconds. The room will get loud. That is good -- it means they are engaged.

After 90 seconds, pull the room back: "Can I get two or three of these? Who heard something wild?" Call on 2-3 volunteers. React genuinely to their stories. You are building rapport AND setting up the entire lesson -- magical realism is exactly this: real life that feels impossible.

After the last story, land the transition: "What you just described -- something real that feels magical -- that is literally what magical realism is about. Latin American writers looked at their lived reality and said, 'this is already so extraordinary that the only honest way to write about it is to treat the impossible as ordinary.' Let's make that precise."

Students: Pair-share, then volunteer stories.

Watch for: If the room is dead silent during pair-share, they are shy because you are a stranger. Walk between a few pairs, lean in, listen, laugh. Your movement gives them permission to talk. If nobody volunteers stories afterward, do not force it -- share one of your own and move on. You have already achieved the goal: they have thought about the concept before you named it.

Time check: You must be transitioning to the definition by minute 8. If the warm-up is going well and students are energized, let one more story land, but do not let this run past 8 minutes. The warm-up is kindling, not the fire.

---

### Phase 2 -- Definition and Devices (Core Content)

**[0:08-0:16] Define magical realism (8 min)**

Speaker: Advance to your definition slide. Build the definition in pieces rather than showing it all at once.

Start with: "Magical realism is a literary mode..." -- pause -- "not a genre. That distinction matters and we will come back to it. A literary mode where supernatural, fantastical, or mythical elements are woven into an otherwise realistic narrative."

Then add the key line: "And here is what makes it different from everything else you have read -- the characters treat these magical elements as completely normal. Nobody freaks out. Nobody says 'oh my god, that is impossible.' The magic is just... Tuesday."

Give one concrete example. If you are drawing from Garcia Marquez: "In 'Cien anos de soledad,' a character ascends to heaven while hanging laundry. The narrator describes it the same way you would describe someone going to the store. That flat, matter-of-fact tone is the signature."

**Quick aside -- what magical realism is NOT (1-2 min, folded into this section):**

Show your "What is it NOT" slide or just say it directly:

- "It is not fantasy. In fantasy, the magic has rules -- there is a magic system, a separate world. In magical realism, the magic has no rules. It is embedded in this world."
- "It is not surrealism. Surrealism is deliberately dreamlike and disorienting. Magical realism is the opposite -- it is grounded, matter-of-fact. The narrator is not surprised, and neither should you be."

That is all you need. Do not belabor the distinction -- this is an aside, not a full segment. Students will encounter these genres later in the course and develop the distinction further. Your job is to plant the seed.

**Historical roots (2-3 min, still within this section):**

Briefly ground the definition in history: "Magical realism exploded in Latin America in the 1960s and 70s -- the 'Boom' period. But it is not just a literary trend. These writers were describing societies where extraordinary things actually happened -- military coups overnight, entire villages displaced, cultures layered on top of each other from colonization. The 'magical' in magical realism is often just reality as experienced by people living through extraordinary circumstances."

If you know any of the students have Latin American heritage, this is where they might light up. Do not call them out, but leave space: "Some of you may recognize this from your own family stories -- that feeling of 'this really happened, but it sounds impossible.'"

Students: Listening, absorbing. Some will be nodding. A few might look confused by "literary mode vs. genre" -- that is fine. It will click when they see examples.

Watch for: If a student asks "what about magical realism in non-Latin American literature?" -- great question, brief answer: "Yes, it exists globally -- Salman Rushdie, Toni Morrison, Haruki Murakami. But its roots and its most celebrated tradition are Latin American, and that is our focus today." Do not let this become a tangent. 30 seconds max.

Time check: By minute 16, you must be transitioning to literary devices. If you are still on the definition, skip the historical roots paragraph -- students can get context from Mr. Sanchez later. The definition and the "what it is not" aside are non-negotiable; the history is valuable but cuttable.

**[0:16-0:26] Key literary devices of magical realism (10 min)**

This is the meatiest section. You are teaching 5 devices. The risk is that this becomes a list students tune out of. Prevent that by attaching each device to a vivid example.

Speaker: Advance to your devices slide (showing just the 5 headers). Say: "Now that we know what magical realism is, let's look at HOW it works on the page. There are five devices that magical realist writers use over and over. Once you know them, you will start seeing them everywhere."

Walk through each device. For each one: name it, define it in one sentence, give one concrete example from a well-known text. Spend roughly 2 minutes per device.

**Device 1: Matter-of-fact narration (the deadpan)**
"The narrator describes impossible events in the same flat tone as ordinary events. 'Remedios la bella ascended to heaven' is written with the same energy as 'Remedios la bella went to the market.' The narrator is not amazed. This is the single most important device -- if you learn one thing about the craft of magical realism, it is this."

Example: The opening of "Cien anos de soledad" -- "Muchos anos despues, frente al peloton de fusilamiento, el coronel Aureliano Buendia habia de recordar aquella tarde remota en que su padre lo llevo a conocer el hielo." The magical thing here is not ice itself -- it is that ice is treated as a wonder equal to facing a firing squad. Past and future collapse into one sentence, and nobody blinks.

**Device 2: Mythic or circular time**
"Time does not work the way you expect. It loops, collapses, or stretches. Characters experience the past and future simultaneously. This is not a flashback technique -- it is a worldview."

Example: The Buendia family in "Cien anos" repeating the same names and the same mistakes across generations, as if time is a circle.

**Device 3: Symbolic or enchanted objects**
"Ordinary objects carry supernatural weight. A recipe, a mirror, a pair of wings. The object is real, but its effects are impossible."

Example: In "Como agua para chocolate," Tita's quail in rose petal sauce causes everyone who eats it to be overcome with longing and desire. The food is real. The effect is magical. Nobody at the table questions it.

**Device 4: Sensory overload**
"Magical realist prose tends to be lush, dense with sensory detail -- colors, smells, textures, sounds. The prose itself feels excessive, almost overwhelming. This is deliberate. The sensory richness makes the magical elements feel embodied, physical, real."

Example: Garcia Marquez's descriptions of Macondo -- the yellow butterflies, the rain that lasts four years, the smell of almonds. You can feel it.

**Device 5: Unresolved supernatural elements**
"The magical event is never explained. There is no twist where we find out it was a dream, or a metaphor, or a hallucination. It happened. The text asks you to accept it the same way the characters do."

Example: The old man with enormous wings in the Garcia Marquez story. He is never explained. He just is.

After all 5, pause and recap: "So: deadpan narration, circular time, enchanted objects, sensory overload, and unresolved magic. Those are your tools for recognizing magical realism. Let's put them to work."

Students: Listening, possibly taking notes. Some will be fascinated by the examples. Others may look slightly overwhelmed by 5 new concepts.

Watch for: If students look glazed by device 3 or 4, you are losing them. Speed up the last two devices and move to the passage -- they will understand the devices better through the passage than through more explanation. The passage is where this clicks.

Affective note: Students are absorbing a lot of new vocabulary. Some may feel like they should already know this since it is an AP class. Normalize it: after device 3, you might say, "These are new tools. You are not supposed to have them memorized yet. You are supposed to recognize them when you see them, and that is exactly what we are about to do."

Time check: By minute 26, you must be handing out Passage B. If you are still on devices, truncate devices 4 and 5 to one sentence each and move to the passage. The passage walkthrough is where the real learning happens -- do not sacrifice it for more lecture.

---

### Phase 3 -- Guided Passage Walkthrough

**[0:26-0:28] Transition -- Distribute Passage B (2 min)**

Speaker: Say: "Now we are going to put these tools to work. I am going to hand out a passage, and we are going to walk through it together. Your job is to spot the devices we just talked about."

Hand out Passage B (the Esquivel excerpt). While students are receiving their copies, put up your Slide 5 -- the analysis framework with these three questions:

1. Where does something impossible happen?
2. How does the narrator treat it? (amazed or matter-of-fact?)
3. Which specific devices from our list can you identify?

Say: "These three questions are your magical realism detector. Take 60 seconds to read the passage silently."

Students: Reading silently.

Watch for: Make sure every student has a copy. If you are short on copies, have students share -- but pairs, not groups of three (someone in a group of three will not read).

**[0:28-0:40] Guided walkthrough -- Analyzing the passage together (12 min)**

This is the centerpiece of the lesson. You are modeling how to do close reading for magical realism. Do not ask students to figure it out alone -- walk them through it, thinking aloud, and invite them in.

Speaker: Read the first 2-3 lines of the passage aloud in Spanish. Then pause.

"Let's start with our first question: where does something impossible happen?" Identify the magical element in the passage (e.g., Tita's cooking causing physical emotional reactions in everyone at the table). Point to the specific lines.

"Now, second question: how does the narrator treat it? Is the narrator shocked? Amazed?" Students should notice that the narrator describes it as if it were perfectly natural. This is matter-of-fact narration -- device 1.

"And third question: what other devices do you see?" Walk through the passage identifying:
- The enchanted object (the food itself -- device 3)
- The sensory overload in the description of the cooking and eating (device 4)
- The unresolved supernatural element -- the text never explains why this happens (device 5)

After you have modeled the first pass, open it up: "What else do you notice? Anything I missed?"

This is where students contribute. They might point out things you did not plan for -- great, validate those observations. If a student offers a reading that does not quite fit, redirect gently: "Interesting -- tell me more about why you see that as magical rather than metaphorical. Where is the line?"

If a student connects magical realism to their own lived experience (as Sergio might -- he has shown this instinct in assessment), amplify it: "That is exactly the kind of connection these writers were making. The 'magic' is not invented -- it is a way of telling the truth about extraordinary reality."

Students: Following along on their printed passage, looking for devices, contributing observations.

Watch for: If students are not volunteering observations at the "what else do you notice?" prompt, do not wait in silence for more than 10 seconds. Try a targeted question: "Look at line 4 -- what sense is the narrator appealing to there? What do you smell?" Sensory questions are easier to answer than literary analysis questions.

Watch for Sergio specifically (if you can identify him -- ask Mr. Sanchez beforehand): His assessment showed strong instincts for connecting magical realism to lived experience and cultural representation. If he contributes, his insight will likely be sophisticated -- build on it. If he is quiet, that is fine too. He finds symbolic interpretation challenging, so he might hold back during close reading. A private "good eye" after class would mean a lot.

Time check: By minute 38, you need to be wrapping up the passage analysis. If discussion is flowing well and students are engaged, let it run to minute 40. If it stalled early, use the remaining time to do a quick second pass through the passage highlighting anything you did not get to. The goal is that students have seen the full analytical process modeled at least once.

**[0:40-0:42] Quick check -- "Could you do this on your own?" (2 min)**

Speaker: Say: "Let's test this. I am going to read you one sentence, and I want you to tell me -- is this magical realism or not? And why?"

Read one sentence that IS magical realism (from Passage A or from memory): something with a clear matter-of-fact supernatural element.

Ask for a quick show of hands or a verbal response. Students should be able to identify it.

Then read one sentence that is NOT (a fantasy sentence with a clearly different tone -- amazement, explanation, a separate magical world).

"Why is this one not magical realism?" Students should point to the tone difference.

This is a low-stakes check. It is not a quiz. It tells you (and them) whether the core concept has landed.

Students: Responding to the quick check.

Watch for: If students struggle to distinguish the two sentences, you have a problem. Do not panic. Say: "The key difference is the narrator's tone. In magical realism, the narrator acts like this is normal. In fantasy, the narrator knows it is extraordinary. That is your north star." Then move on -- they will develop this skill over the course of the year with Mr. Sanchez.

---

### Phase 4 -- Close

**[0:42-0:47] Wrap-up -- Landing the lesson (5 min)**

Speaker: Return to your opening contract: "I said you would be able to spot magical realism in a passage by the end of this period. Let's see where we are."

Recap the three takeaways by counting on your fingers:

"One: magical realism is a literary mode where the supernatural is woven into realistic narrative, and nobody in the story thinks it is strange.

Two: you now know five devices to look for -- deadpan narration, circular time, enchanted objects, sensory overload, and unresolved magic.

Three: you have a three-question framework for analyzing any passage -- where is the impossible thing, how does the narrator treat it, and which devices can you name?"

Then bridge to their course: "You are going to read Garcia Marquez, Borges, Allende, Esquivel this year. When you do, you already have the tools. You are not starting from zero."

If time permits, leave them with one evocative teaser: "The next time something impossible happens in your own life -- something your abuela told you that cannot possibly be true but definitely is -- that is the spirit of magical realism. These writers were not making things up. They were telling the truth in the only way that made sense."

Students: Listening, possibly feeling a sense of accomplishment. The callback to the warm-up (family stories) closes the emotional loop.

Watch for: The bell is about to ring. Do not start a new thought after minute 47. Students will mentally check out the moment they hear the 2-minute warning or see the clock.

**[0:47-0:50] Handoff to Mr. Sanchez and exit (3 min)**

Speaker: Turn to Mr. Sanchez: "Mr. Sanchez, I'll hand it back to you." This gives him time for any housekeeping.

If students approach you with questions afterward, stay and engage if you can -- those post-class conversations are gold for a guest speaker. But the formal lesson is done.

Students: Packing up, possibly approaching with questions.

## Activities

### Activity 1: Warm-Up Pair Share -- "The Most Surreal Thing"

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Objective** | Build rapport, activate prior experience, prime the concept of "real but impossible" |
| **Duration** | 5 minutes (90 sec pair-share + 2-3 min whole-class share) |
| **Format** | Paired, then whole-class |
| **Materials** | None |

**Instructions:**
1. Ask students to think of the most surreal, unbelievable, or magical thing that has ever happened to them or someone in their family
2. Have them turn to a neighbor and share (90 seconds)
3. Ask for 2-3 volunteers to share with the whole class
4. React genuinely and bridge to the lesson: "That is magical realism"

**Success criteria:**
Students have activated the concept of "real events that feel impossible" before you ever define the term. At least 2 students have shared a story.

**Common pitfalls:**
- Students too shy to share with a stranger at the front: Walk between pairs during the share. Your proximity gives permission. If no one volunteers for whole-class, share your own story and move on.
- Stories get long: Gently cut in after 30 seconds per share: "I love that. One more?"
- A student says "nothing magical has ever happened to me": "What about something your family talks about that sounds impossible but they swear is true?"

### Activity 2: Guided Passage Walkthrough -- "Como agua para chocolate" Excerpt

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Objective** | Model close reading for magical realism; students identify specific devices in a real passage |
| **Duration** | 12 minutes |
| **Format** | Whole-class guided analysis (speaker-led with student contributions) |
| **Materials** | Printed Passage B (Esquivel excerpt), projector showing the 3-question framework |

**Instructions:**
1. Distribute passage. Give 60 seconds for silent reading.
2. Read opening lines aloud in Spanish.
3. Walk through the 3-question framework:
   - Where does something impossible happen? (Identify the magical element together)
   - How does the narrator treat it? (Notice the matter-of-fact tone)
   - Which devices can you name? (Connect to the 5 devices from lecture)
4. After modeling the analysis, open to student contributions: "What else do you notice?"
5. Validate contributions. Redirect gently if needed.

**Success criteria:**
Students can point to specific lines in the passage and connect them to at least 2 of the 5 devices by name. At least 3-4 students contribute observations during the open discussion.

**Common pitfalls:**
- Students cannot find the magical element: Point them to the specific lines. "Look at what happens when they eat the food. Is that possible in real life?"
- Students confuse metaphor with magical realism: "Great question. The difference is that in the story, this is not figurative -- it literally happens. The characters literally experience these physical reactions. That is what makes it magical realism, not metaphor."
- Only one or two students participate: Use targeted questions about sensory details (easier entry point). "What do you smell in this passage? What do you see?" Then build from there to analysis.

### Activity 3: Quick Check -- "Magical Realism or Not?"

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Objective** | Verify that students can distinguish magical realism from other genres based on narrator tone |
| **Duration** | 2 minutes |
| **Format** | Whole-class call-and-response |
| **Materials** | Two prepared sentences (one magical realism, one fantasy) |

**Instructions:**
1. Read a sentence that IS magical realism. Ask: "Is this magical realism? Why?"
2. Read a sentence that is NOT. Ask: "What about this one? Why not?"
3. Students should identify the narrator's tone as the key difference.

**Success criteria:**
Majority of students correctly identify both sentences and can articulate the difference (matter-of-fact tone vs. amazement/explanation).

**Common pitfalls:**
- Students get both wrong: This means the core concept has not landed. Give the answer directly: "The difference is the narrator's tone. This is your north star for the rest of the year." Do not spiral into re-teaching.
- Students get the "is" right but cannot articulate why: Feed them the language: "What is the narrator doing differently? Is the narrator surprised?"

---

## Contingency Notes

### If students struggle with the warm-up (no one shares)

Share your own "surreal but true" story. Make it vivid and short (30 seconds). Then say: "See? That felt impossible but it happened. That is the territory we are in today." Move on. The warm-up failed to generate student stories but you still primed the concept.

### If you are running behind at minute 16

You are supposed to be starting literary devices by minute 16. If you are still on the definition:

- Cut the historical roots paragraph entirely. Students will get this context from Mr. Sanchez throughout the year.
- Keep the definition and the "what it is NOT" aside -- those are non-negotiable.
- For the devices section, cut devices down to the 3 most essential: (1) matter-of-fact narration, (2) enchanted objects, and (3) unresolved supernatural elements. Mention "circular time" and "sensory overload" by name only, without examples.

### If you are running behind at minute 28

You are supposed to be starting the passage walkthrough by minute 28. If you are still on devices:

- Stop lecturing. Hand out the passage immediately.
- Walk through the passage and teach the remaining devices THROUGH the passage rather than in the abstract. "See this line? This is what I mean by sensory overload." This is actually a better teaching approach anyway -- you just did not have time to set it up cleanly.

### If students are not engaging during the passage walkthrough

Switch from open questions ("What do you notice?") to targeted questions ("Look at line 3. What sense is being described?"). Sensory questions are easier than analytical questions. Build from sensory observations to literary analysis: "Good, you noticed the smell. Now, is it normal for food to have THAT effect on people? What is the narrator doing with that?"

### If a student challenges the definition or pushes back intellectually

This is a gift in an AP class. Engage with it briefly: "That is a great challenge. Tell me more." Let them articulate their point. Then address it directly or, if it is a genuinely complex issue (like "is 'One Hundred Years of Solitude' fantasy?"), say: "That is exactly the kind of debate literary scholars have. Mr. Sanchez is going to take you deeper into that this year. For today, here is the working definition we are using." Do not let the debate consume more than 2 minutes.

### If the projector fails

Teach from the printed passages and your voice. The slides are a visual aid, not the content. For the definition and devices, write the 5 device names on the whiteboard. For the passage walkthrough, everything is on the printed handout. The session works without tech.

---

## What to Cut If You Are Short on Time

In order of what to cut first:

1. **Historical roots of magical realism** (saves 2-3 min) -- Students will get this from Mr. Sanchez. The definition stands without it.
2. **Devices 4 and 5 (sensory overload and unresolved supernatural)** -- reduce to one sentence each (saves 3-4 min). These two are the most intuitive and students will pick them up from the passage.
3. **The quick check activity** (saves 2 min) -- If you did the passage walkthrough well, students have already demonstrated recognition. The quick check is confirmation, not teaching.
4. **The wrap-up recap** (saves 3 min) -- If truly desperate, end with the passage walkthrough and say: "The three questions on the board are your toolkit. Use them." Not ideal, but the passage is where the learning happened.

**Do NOT cut:**
- The warm-up. Without it, you are a stranger lecturing at teenagers. With it, you are a person they shared a story with.
- The passage walkthrough. This is where the "one thing" lives. Without it, students heard about magical realism but did not practice recognizing it.
- The definition and the "what it is NOT" aside. These are the conceptual foundation everything else rests on.

## Prerequisite Audit Notes

**Critical gap identified:** The skill graph shows "distinguish-magical-realism-from-related-genres" as a prerequisite for "recognize-magical-realism-in-passage." This skill is not being taught as a full segment in this session. Mitigation: the distinction is folded into the definition section as a quick aside ("what it is NOT -- not fantasy, not surrealism"). This plants the seed without consuming a full teaching segment. Students will develop this distinction further throughout the AP course. For today's purposes, the aside is sufficient to support passage recognition.

**Unassessed learners:** Only 1 of the class has been assessed (Sergio). The plan assumes AP-level reading comprehension in Spanish and basic literary terminology from English classes. If this assumption is wrong for a significant number of students, the passage walkthrough will reveal it -- watch for students who cannot follow the Spanish text. Mitigation: read key lines aloud and provide brief contextual glosses for difficult vocabulary.

**Assessed learner note (Sergio):** Strong historical context (0.94), strong device intuition (0.94), developing definition knowledge (0.63). He is likely to contribute sophisticated observations during the passage walkthrough, especially connecting magical realism to lived experience. His weaker area is symbolic interpretation -- he may hold back during close reading. He does not need special accommodation; he needs space to contribute what he is good at.

---

## Affective Context Notes

**No affective data on file for this group.** The following recommendations are based on the guest speaker situation and AP class assumptions:

- **Confidence-building tone throughout.** This is a new topic for most students. Start with the guaranteed-win warm-up so every student has a successful interaction before encountering new vocabulary.
- **Guest speaker dynamics.** Students may be more reserved than usual. The warm-up pair-share (talking to a neighbor, not the stranger) lowers the barrier. Do not cold-call in the first 10 minutes -- let students warm up to your presence.
- **Normalizing newness.** After the devices section, explicitly normalize that this is new: "You are not supposed to have these memorized. You are supposed to recognize them." This prevents AP students from feeling like they should already know this.
- **The passage walkthrough is speaker-led, not student-led.** This is deliberate. A guest speaker does not have the relationship capital to ask students to do independent analytical work and risk public failure. By modeling the analysis and inviting contributions, you give students a safe way to participate without the pressure of performing.

---

## Educator Profile Notes

No educator profile exists for this guest speaker. This plan is composed without educator-specific customization. The plan defaults to:
- **Lecture-forward structure** as requested by the educator ("this is more of a lecture")
- **Full talking points and suggested phrasings** since the engine cannot calibrate content scaffolding to an unknown educator's expertise level
- **Specific contingency alternatives** rather than open-ended pivots, since the engine has no data on the speaker's improvisation comfort level
- **Generous stage direction** to support a speaker who may be unfamiliar with this specific classroom's dynamics

## Teaching Wisdom Notes

No accumulated teaching wisdom exists for the spanish-literature domain yet. This is the first session in this domain. After the session, a post-session debrief will seed the wisdom layer with timing patterns, confusion points, and success patterns that will improve future plans for this group and domain.
