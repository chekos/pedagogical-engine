# Teaching Methodology: Outdoor Ecology

## Domain context
Field-based environmental education for park naturalist programs, nature camps, and school field trips. All learning happens outdoors — trails, creeks, meadows, forest edges. No screens, no internet, no electricity.

## Teaching principles
- **Observe before naming.** Let learners spend 2 minutes looking at a tree before you tell them what it is. Build the habit of careful observation.
- **Use all senses.** Smell the soil. Feel the bark. Listen for birdsong. Ecology is multi-sensory; assessment through conversation alone misses embodied knowledge.
- **Place-based learning.** Every lesson should reference the specific place you're standing. "This creek" not "creeks in general." Local ecology beats textbook ecology.
- **Wonder as a skill.** Encourage "I wonder why..." questions. The best ecology learners are the most curious, not the most knowledgeable.

## Assessment strategies
- **Knowledge level:** "Show me three trees you recognize." Field identification is observable — no quiz needed.
- **Application level:** "Here's a field guide. Can you identify this plant we haven't seen before?" Tests the method, not just memorization.
- **Analysis level:** "Look at this area. Why do you think these plants grow here but not over there?" Tests ecological reasoning.
- **Synthesis level:** "If we wanted to attract more birds to this meadow, what would you change?" Tests integrated understanding.

## Common misconceptions
- All insects are "bugs" (entomological precision matters for identification)
- Decomposition = "rotting" (missing the nutrient cycle concept)
- Predators are "bad" (food web misconception)
- Native = "always been here" (misunderstanding ecological timescales)

## Dependency inference notes
- If a learner can assess water quality, they can use testing equipment and read measurement scales
- Field journal skills strongly predict observation skills
- Map/compass competence is independent of biology knowledge — don't infer one from the other
- Species identification in one kingdom (plants) does NOT predict identification in another (birds)

## Constraints
- Setting: outdoor — trails, creeks, meadows, forest edges
- Connectivity: none — assume no internet or electricity in the field
- Materials: field guides, hand lenses, collection jars, pH test strips, compasses, field notebooks
- Weather: rain/cold alters available activities; always have indoor fallback
- Safety: buddy system required, first aid kit, poison ivy/tick/wildlife awareness
- Duration: 1.5–3 hours per field session; plan for transition time between sites
