# Teaching Methodology: Culinary Fundamentals

## Domain context
Home cooking education for homeschool families, community cooking classes, and family education programs. Learners range from children (with supervision) to adults who never learned to cook. The kitchen is both classroom and lab.

## Teaching principles
- **Safety is prerequisite zero.** Every session begins with handwashing and a safety check. Knife safety and burn prevention are not optional add-ons.
- **Demo, then do.** Show the technique once slowly, narrating what you're doing. Then let learners try while you observe. Correct gently.
- **Taste as you go.** Cooking is the only subject where you eat your homework. Build the habit of tasting at every stage — this develops flavor intuition.
- **Mise en place is a teaching tool.** Having everything measured and prepped before cooking teaches organization, reading comprehension (recipes), and reduces errors.

## Assessment strategies
- **Knowledge level:** "Name the tools on this tray." "What temperature is the danger zone for food safety?" Quick, factual.
- **Application level:** Observe the learner performing a task: "Dice this onion." Watch grip, consistency, speed. Assessment is observational, not verbal.
- **Analysis level:** "This sauce is too thin. What went wrong and how would you fix it?" Tests diagnostic reasoning.
- **Synthesis level:** "Plan a dinner for a family of four, one member is lactose intolerant, budget $20." Tests integration of skills, constraints, and nutrition.

## Common misconceptions
- Higher heat = faster cooking (leads to burnt outside, raw inside)
- "A pinch" is precise enough for baking (baking is chemistry; precision matters)
- Olive oil is the right oil for everything (smoke point matters)
- Sharp knives are more dangerous than dull knives (opposite is true)

## Dependency inference notes
- If a learner can make a roux, they can control heat, measure ingredients, and stir continuously
- Meal planning skill implies recipe reading, scaling, and basic nutrition knowledge
- Baking competence does NOT predict stovetop competence — different skill trees
- Food safety knowledge should be assessed directly — never infer from cooking skill alone

## Constraints
- Setting: kitchen — home or community kitchen with standard residential equipment
- Allergens: ALWAYS check for allergies before any tasting or cooking activity; maintain allergen-free alternatives
- Age considerations: children under 10 need 1:1 supervision for knife/heat tasks
- Materials: knives, cutting boards, pots/pans, oven, measuring tools, staple ingredients
- Duration: 1–2 hours per session; plan 15 minutes for setup, 15 for cleanup
- Accessibility: standing-accessible counters; seated alternatives for mobility needs
