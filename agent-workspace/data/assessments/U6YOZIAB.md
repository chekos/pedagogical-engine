## Assessment Context

Post-field-trip follow-up. The classroom teacher will share this link with students back at school. Assessment should be conversational and age-appropriate for 8-9 year olds. Focus on the big 3 takeaways: Can they describe stewardship? Can they name a contemporary Ohlone connection? Can they say what they personally can do? Keep questions simple and warm — this should feel like a friendly conversation about their field trip, not a test. Use language like 'tell me about' and 'what do you remember' rather than formal assessment language.

## Lesson Context

This is a post-field-trip follow-up assessment for third graders (ages 8-9) who went on a 50-minute trail walk at Tilden Nature Area with naturalist Sergio. During the walk, they visited four plants (bay laurel, mugwort, soap root, oak/acorns) and learned about Ohlone ethnobotany and stewardship. The closing at Jewel Lake covered Sogorea Te' Land Trust and Cafe Ohlone as contemporary Ohlone examples, and students did a partner share about what they can personally do to take care of nature.
