## Interview Context

- **Topic:** Culinary fundamentals — knife skills, stovetop cooking, flavor building, and preparing a complete meal
- **Duration:** 90 minutes (10:00 AM – 11:30 AM)
- **Setting:** Home kitchen at the Chen-Martinez house — residential kitchen with a gas stove, oven, standard counter space. Island counter serves as the teaching station. Kids work at the island and the dining table (for non-heat tasks).
- **Audience:** Homeschool co-op kids ages 8–12, mixed experience levels from total beginner to experienced family cook
- **Tools available:** Chef's knives (8-inch, adult-supervised only), paring knives, cutting boards (color-coded: green for produce, red for meat), measuring cups and spoons, kitchen scale, instant-read thermometer, mixing bowls, whisk, spatula, two burner stations, one oven
- **Connectivity:** Available but not needed — printed recipe cards used during cooking
- **Prior sessions:** 1 previous session — kitchen tour, safety rules, hand-washing practice, identified and named all tools

## Constraints

- 90-minute session with 15-minute cleanup built in (75 minutes of active teaching)
- Maximum 2 kids at the stovetop at once — adult must be within arm's reach
- Owen has a SEVERE TREE NUT AND PEANUT ALLERGY — no nuts in any recipe, check all ingredient labels, separate cutting boards if any nut products are in the house
- Theo has celiac disease — all recipes must be gluten-free or have a GF alternative prepared
- Zara follows halal dietary requirements — meat must be halal-certified, no pork products, no alcohol-based vanilla extract (use vanilla bean paste instead)
- Owen (age 8) should not use chef's knife unsupervised — paring knife with hand-over-hand guidance, or assign him tearing/mixing tasks
- Keep sharp knives out of reach when not actively supervised
- All kids must wash hands before and after handling raw ingredients
- Parents are present but should observe, not take over — this is the kids' learning experience
- Lily's younger siblings (ages 7, 5) may be present — give them a separate simple task (washing vegetables, stirring batter) to keep them occupied and safe
