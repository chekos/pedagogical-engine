## Members

24 third graders (treated as a group, not individually profiled):
- ~50% English learners (Spanish and Cantonese primary languages)
- Majority at EL emerging-to-expanding levels (mixed range)
- 4 parent chaperones available as small group leaders

## Interview Context

**Setting:** Little Farm at Tilden Nature Area, East Bay Regional Parks
**Date:** Next Tuesday (Feb 2026)
**Duration:** 2 hours total (90 minutes usable after arrival/bathroom and wrap-up)
**Materials:** Clipboards, crayons, portable whiteboard

**Prior knowledge:**
- Classroom unit on seasons and weather completed
- Most have seen pictures of farms but never visited one
- A few kids have family gardens
- First farm visit for most students

**Learning goals (from educator):**
1. Trace a food item from seed/animal to their plate
2. Name at least 3 farm animals and what they provide
3. Understand that plants grow from seeds and need sun/water/soil

**Assessment preference:** Simple worksheet at each station — drawings and one-sentence answers (many developing writers)

## Constraints

### Accessibility
- **Wheelchair user (1 student):** All activities must be on paved paths; station placement on flat, accessible ground
- **Asthma (2 students):** Avoid hay barn; be mindful of dust; position these students upwind when possible

### Language
- **~50% English learners:** Spanish and Cantonese speakers
- All instructions needed in Spanish (educator request)
- Heavy visual scaffolding and hands-on activities preferred over lecture
- Key vocabulary needs pre-teaching with picture support

### Logistics
- **4 parent chaperones:** Each can lead a small group of 6
- Must stay on paved paths for wheelchair access
- Must avoid hay barn (asthma)
- No technology available — clipboards, crayons, portable whiteboard only
