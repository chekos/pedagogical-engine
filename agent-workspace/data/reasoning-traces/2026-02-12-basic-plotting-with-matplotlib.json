An inductive approach (exercise-first) would leave Alex completely lost. By front-loading the demos, Alex sees the pattern 4 times before having to reproduce it. Priya and Sofia (who are already at application level) stay engaged because the demos introduce NEW syntax (matplotlib) even though the concepts are familiar.",

Teaching wisdom from 18 previous sessions indicates that plotting exercises typically take 10-15 minutes for mixed groups. The 12-minute allocation is the sweet spot — long enough for Alex to get 2 charts working (with Priya's help), short enough to keep Priya/Sofia engaged (they'll finish in 5-7 minutes and move to extensions).",

Priya gets the synthesis-level challenge of explaining, which exercises skills she doesn't normally use. Nkechi works solo because she needs to build Python muscle memory — pairing would let her delegate the typing.

(2) It gives the educator 3 minutes to walk to Alex's station and help with notebook setup while the group discusses. (3) It creates ownership — when students suggest 'sales over time' as a question, and then the demo shows exactly that, the demo feels like answering their question rather than lecturing at them.

The starter notebook sidesteps this by pre-loading the DataFrame, so Alex can focus on plotting — which IS the learning objective. Nkechi's weak import-pandas score (0.55) is also mitigated.

A quiz would create anxiety (Alex just struggled through the exercise). A discussion would diffuse focus. Writing the universal pattern on the whiteboard and saying it aloud — while students see it with fresh eyes from having just USED it — creates the strongest memory encoding.
